- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes
    to develop a faster and more accurate optical instrument for studying live cells
    and tissues. The study of live cells has yielded numerous discoveries (e.g. germ
    theory, the Krebs cycle, cell division) and is important for drug discovery and
    disease treatment. Live cells are transparent and need to be observed for long
    periods of time (days, weeks) in their natural state. To make the cells visible
    and measure them quantitatively, current state of the art instruments require
    injecting the cells with staining agents or light emitting fluorophores. Both
    processes are invasive, labor intensive and expensive and long term observations
    of live cells is difficult: staining embalms the cells and the fluorophores fade
    quickly and kill the cells in hours. The Phase I project produced a proof-of-concept
    prototype that provides quantitative imaging of live cells by processing the light
    transmitted through the cells in their natural state. Completion of the Phase
    II objectives will upgrade the Phase I prototype to a commercial grade instrument:
    improve optical design and build a housing enclosure, develop commercial grade
    software and automate the hardware controls and develop task-specific software
    applications to solve particular biological problems. \n\t\n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is to enable life scientists with a new and powerful
    instrument for studying live cells. The greatest impact of the commercial instrument
    developed in Phase II project will have is enabling researchers to do science
    better than before, i.e., more accurately, more quantitatively, and more noninvasively.
    The range of breakthroughs enabled by the instrument will likely include: novel
    drug discovery by accurate monitoring of cell response to treatment, fundamental
    studies of cell proliferation and growth, minimally invasive automatic diagnosis
    of cancer biopsies, and fast and accurate blood testing instruments. Scaling up
    the production of the instrument will create new jobs and increase the US dominance
    in the biotechnology area. Due to their full automation, the instruments can also
    operate in areas with limited access to trained personnel and provide the digital
    data necessary for remote diagnosis, such as Medically Underserved Areas/Populations
    in United States."

    to develop a handheld, one-step paper-based device for rapid self-testing of sexually
    transmitted infections. The company aims to replace lab-based assays for Chlamydia
    trachomatis (CT) and expand testing access to previously unreachable settings.
    The technology combines the ease-of-use and very low cost of rapid point-of-care
    (POC) diagnostics with the high accuracy of lab-based tests, enabling unprecedented
    reliability at the POC and at home. CT infection is one of the most prevalent
    STIs in the US. An estimated three million new cases occur each year with direct
    annual medical costs of greater than $3.5 billion. Untreated CT, symptomatic or
    not, may cause long term pregnancy complications, even infertility. Traditional
    lab-based CT assays prevent the ability to test-and-treat within one patient visit.
    This delay results in a high number of cases that do not get treatment due to
    loss-to-follow up (especially for young STI patients) and increased infection
    transmission. Phase Diagnostics? novel device will be: (1) Fast: Results to the
    patient in less than 15 minutes; (2) Affordable: Costs less than $1 to manufacture;
    (3) Accurate: Sensitivity and specificity on par with lab-based assays; (4) Convenient:
    Handheld with no required equipment or training. \n\nThe key innovation of the
    company's novel device is to use aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to selectively
    pre-concentrate the pathogenic bacteria prior to detection, thereby dramatically
    enhancing the accuracy of conventional rapid LFA POC technology and enabling the
    use of urine samples for the detection of CT. During Phase I, the company was
    able to adapt ATPS to urine medium, attain improved limits of detection of its
    system and make considerable progress in fully integrating all components into
    a true one-step paper microfluidic strip. The objective of Phase II is to fully
    develop the company's proposed device to be ready for FDA 510(k) clearance and
    CLIA waiver enabling clinical studies. The company will first complete the product
    optimization work initiated in Phase I and perform additional device robustness
    studies. As these experiments near completion, the company will work with a contract
    prototyper to design and develop prototypes based on the final optimized device
    components. At the same time, the company will establish small scale manufacturing
    processes to ensure that it can generate a reproducible pilot batch. The company
    will then perform Alpha and Beta product testing to determine the clinical performance
    of its prototype as well as obtain feedback from end-users to determine areas
    for optimization."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be the discovery of new ionization technology for use with mass spectrometry.  This technology will enable lower cost, lower energy use, and reduced user expertise, which may potentially drive mass spectrometry into large and underserved markets such as medical diagnostics and field portable instruments designed specifically for use in homeland security, bedside diagnostics, or bio-threat detection. The new technology changes the current understanding of ionization processes used in mass spectrometry and provides opportunities for new innovations to advance science through improved measurements, impacting fields such as health, safety, and security. The aims of this Phase II project are to develop interfaces to incorporate the platform developed in Phase I on most major mass spectrometer manufacturer's instruments and to develop technologies for rapid automate analyses even of surfaces.  The research of Phase II is aimed to better understand the fundamentals of this new technology in order to drive commercial success in high sensitivity rapid analyses at a competitive price. Mass spectrometers are widely used representing a $4 billion industry of which ionization technology represents a significant commercial opportunity.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to revolutionize ionization in mass spectrometry by providing commercial products that utilize a simple and powerful ionization technology. The newly discovered process spontaneously converts large and small, volatile and nonvolatile compounds to the gas-phase ions necessary for analysis using mass spectrometry without employing currently used high cost lasers or high voltage. The method is broadly applicable for analysis of compounds such as drugs, lipids, carbohydrate conjugates, peptides, and proteins directly from bodily fluids or tissue, as well as synthetic polymers and inorganic catalytic surfaces.  This technology is anticipated to augment or even replace older ionization methods in applications such as clinical analyses, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental, and food safety. The aims of the Phase II project are to implement the multifunctional platform developed during Phase I on a variety of manufacturer's instruments, automate the process to allow lower cost and faster analyses, and provide an automated surface analysis platform.  Besides determining the best sample preparation methodologies and choice of solvents/matrices, the research objectives include innovative automated sample introduction technologies that eliminate the need for a conventional "ion source" while reducing the pumping requirements, which currently hinder development of small, low-cost portable mass spectrometers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

    In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.

    develop a technology to transform swine manure into sustainable alternatives for
    petroleum-based adhesives, with a first opportunity in the asphalt market.  This
    project builds on a successful Phase I effort as well as a prior Innovation Corps
    award. The major socio-economic impact of the technology will be in rural areas,
    as it will allow pig farmers to alleviate the burden of manure management and
    create a new revenue stream.  This project also offers a novel approach to develop
    low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly construction adhesives, reduce the cost associated
    with manure management and lagoon maintenance, create new manufacturing and engineering
    jobs, and reduce our dependence on petroleum resources. Current practices for
    handling manure release carbon to the atmosphere, either from manure storage or
    anaerobic digestion of manure. In contrast, the proposed technology sequesters
    carbon in bio-adhesives, while passing nutrients to the effluents, bio-char, and
    grey water, which can then be used as fertilizer.  The Phase I research results
    have shown that bio-adhesive is more durable, lower in cost ($0.50/gallon, as
    compared with $2.00/gallon) and more eco-friendly (lower volatile organic compound
    levels) than many petroleum-based adhesives.\n \nThe core technology to be developed
    further in this effort uses thermochemical liquefaction to convert swine manure
    to bio-oil, followed by the polymerization of bio-oil to produce bio-adhesives.
    This technology will eventually enable use of the six billion gallons of swine
    manure that are generated annually in the U.S. to supply about 88 million barrels
    of bio-adhesive.  As a result of the Phase I effort, a study of the effects of
    heating rate on the yield and quality of bio-adhesive was completed; this in turn,
    helped ensure that the conversion process takes place successfully, thereby addressing
    one of the main scale-up challenges. The resulting data were used as an input
    for the design of a pilot bio-reactor, including central heaters and a heat exchanger.
    \ After the design phase, the team began the fabrication and assembly of this
    bio-reactor, and followed up with multiple trials.  In the Phase II project, building
    on these successful trials, we will complete the troubleshooting of the bio-reactor
    while finalizing the design and construction of the oil separation and polymerization
    column, and sampling valves.  These items will permit a fully-realized pilot plant
    by the end of this project."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project presents novel technology to fabricate dry, removable, reusable adhesives based on aligned polymeric nanofibers using scalable electrospinning methodologies.  This new approach offers the potential advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle-free nanofiber spinning processes. Dry reusable adhesives as a replacement for messy liquid glues will improve product safety and reduce environmental impact. Removable and reusable adhesive tapes and labels will also eliminate waste and facilitate product recycling. The resulting products will have strong shear adhesion and easy peel, leading to broad application with a wide range of substrates like glass, metal, wall board, and plastics. Proof-of-concept samples have confirmed market-driven value propositions. The Phase II project will develop commercial products and applications for consumer and industrial applications, for automotive assembly systems, for decorative wall murals, and for medical device and health care uses. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the manufacturing process.

    The Phase I project has confirmed proof-of-concept dry adhesive samples with shear adhesion strengths exceeding 20 N/cm2 in dynamic mode and 45 N/cm2 in dead weight mode.  The resulting samples have low peel strength and are reusable. In Phase II, the electrospinning process will be optimized using novel polymer blend systems to achieve performance targets for specific customer product development. The nozzleless electrospinning process will be scaled to the pilot level for product testing and to provide the engineering design basis for commercial manufacture. A continuous roll-to-roll process to produce aligned nanofibers will break new ground in the electrospinning industry.  New applications in medical devices have been proposed by strategic partners to capitalize on the self-adhesion properties of these materials.  Dry adhesive applicator systems will be developed to allow the aligned adhesive nanofibers to conform to surface asperities. With the Phase I success of proof-of-concept prototypes, the Phase II effort will move the development of aligned nanofiber dry adhesives into the market introduction phase in preparation for commercial manufacture and sales.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to industry stakeholders holding financial
    interests that are impacted by climate change. Climate change has a scientifically
    evident impact on the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme weather events.
    It has become imperative for organizations in all sectors to gain a clear understanding
    of the impacts of climate change on their business so as to inform strategic planning
    and risk management strategies. Those in the risk transfer industry, in particular
    reinsurance companies, are the most likely early adopters given their technical
    sophistication and their increasing and acute awareness of the financial impacts
    climate change now has on their bottom line. Thus, the company's goal is to penetrate
    the reinsurance industry as an entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer
    industry. Subsequently, the company will utilize the platform to address problems
    in agricultural investment, real estate investment, and energy planning - all
    sectors that will be adversely impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined
    ways. The adaptation in each of these sectors is vital to the well-being and prosperity
    of the ultimate stakeholder: the American taxpayer. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project aims to harness industry knowledge and expand on the
    technical work conducted during the company's Phase I project, with the objective
    of building a modular software platform generalizable to multiple key climate
    change hazards and extensible to other strategically identified sectors. The knowledge
    gathered via customer discovery interviews in Phase I will serve as a guide for
    product development. The technical work completed in Phase I, in particular extreme
    precipitation modeling under climate change and its application to the risk transfer
    sector, will serve as a foundation for expansion into the modeling of additional
    hazards. There are currently no tools available that integrate climate change
    informatics into risk management at scale. The company aims to address this problem
    through the translation of physics-guided statistical modeling to a commercial
    software platform. Upon conclusion of the Phase II project, the company expects
    to have a completed product that will house data on additional hazards exacerbated
    by climate change, with applications in the agriculture, commercial real estate,
    and the energy sectors. The company will show product value through sector-tailored
    software demonstrations and case studies that demonstrate return on investment
    to be realized by using this platform.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a novel probe-based direct transfer (PBDT) printing technology for manufacturing flexible hybrid electronic (FHE) devices. PBDT promises to deliver unprecedented selective, high-fidelity component transfer of a broad range of low-dimensional, high-performance electronic components with diverse architectures and sizes to flexible substrates. The technology will accelerate manufacturing capability to meet a critical need in the flexible and printed electronics market. The development of a stand-alone, automatic PBDT tool will provide flexible electronics developers and manufacturers an unparalleled solution for integrating high-performance thin and ultra-thin electronic materials into next-generation flexible devices. The impact on the market and on daily life has the potential to be transformative, with everything from consumer devices (e.g., flexible phones and tablets), to imaging and sensing, to health care and homeland security being improved by advancements in flexible device manufacturing. Furthermore, PBDT will enable new directions in flexible device research and product development. 

     The overall objective of the Phase II project is to produce a prototype of a commercial version of a PBDT tool. In addition, detailed performance specs of the process and tool will be established, and functional FHE devices will be assembled using automated PBDT printing. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that the PBDT approach of handling a flexible substrate as both a stamp and as the destination substrate allows for defect-free transfer of semiconductor components that are an order of magnitude thinner and more complex laterally than what conventional tools can handle. Based on the Phase I accomplishments, Phase II funding will be used to develop and demonstrate a prototype tool that will serve as the template for a fully automated commercial product. Successful commercialization of PBDT will require advances in PBDT processes and hardware; therefore, the specific objectives of the Phase II project are focused on (i) characterizing the full process space of PBDT technology, (ii) demonstrating a complete process flow for assembling and metalizing functional FHE devices, and (iii) validating the prototype in terms of printing rate and fidelity. The collaborating university partner will contribute to the design and fabrication of thin and ultra-thin silicon components to assess the performance of the tool and demonstrate viable FHE sensors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the advancement of a novel water treatment process that reduces membrane fouling and significantly lowers water treatment costs. Membrane filtration is one of the primary water treatment technologies to address the global challenge of water scarcity. However, the membrane industry suffers from low productivity and high operational cost caused by fouling. Over 95% of the water treatment plants in US that employ membrane filtration currently operate at only 30-50% of their design capacity. Our revolutionary pretreatment technology not only mitigates fouling, but also increases system productivity by up to 400% and decreases the required membrane cleaning frequency by a factor of 50, thereby saving water, money and energy. The process can reduce both the capital expense and annual operational cost of water treatment plants by roughly 25%. Our innovation is also applicable to saline water, so it can be used as a pretreatment for desalination, and it can address another major environmental challenge by removing phosphorus from wastewater and thereby reducing the prevalence of blooms of toxic algae.

    This SBIR Phase II project will continue our scale-up and commercialization activities for our pretreatment technology to improve the performance of membranes in water treatment processes with respect to contaminant removal, process productivity, and energy efficiency, compared to existing technologies. The process relies on application of a proprietary particle in a novel reactor and has been demonstrated in our Phase I work. The objectives of the Phase II work are (1) scale-up and construction of larger treatment modules using commercially suitable materials and fabrication processes; (2) testing under more aggressive operational conditions; (3) improving particle production, delivery, and disposal processes; and (4) evaluating the particles' suitability as an economic approach to remove and recover phosphorus from wastewater. The economic analysis will also be updated using data collected in Phase II study. The effort will advance the technical readiness level (TRL) of our process to TRL6, while providing essential data for further development and credibility for marketing. On completion of Phase II, we expect to be prepared for deployment in small-scale commercial systems treating one million gallons per day, and for testing in larger systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from addressing the thermal challenges brought about by the significant increase in transistor density that semiconductors have experienced over the past few decades. This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance.

    The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers. In addition to the chip testing market segment, in Phase II products will be developed for entry into the TIM1 and Internet of Things markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project will be the enhanced ability to monitor NOx optically using a unique approach that is fundamentally different from voltage biased solid electrolyte diffusion technology deployed commercially today. NSF Phase I activities brought to light the shortcomings of existing sensor technology, including slow response time and up to 90% "garbage data" that OEMs and regulatory authorities have to work around. Phase II efforts include improvement of Phase I prototypes where near instantaneous NOx detection to ~200 ppm was observed. NOx are a major pollutant and precursor to acid rain, surface ozone and smog formation. Worldwide regulatory bodies are driving NOx regulations to increasingly stringent levels, thus presenting even greater challenges for real-world emissions. Addressing these regulations, industry must deploy after-treatment technologies including selective catalyst reduction systems and lean NOx traps. Both of these technologies will benefit from a less expensive, more robust, and faster responding NOx sensor. With continued success, the new NOx sensor has the potential to significantly reduce emissions levels through a more accurate and much faster detection than current NOx detection techniques thus allowing the internal combustion engine to directly employ detection feedback to enhance emission controls.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the prototyping and characterization of an optical based Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) sensor technology not based on oxygen sensor derivatives found in the market today. We will further optimize the design and materials needed for a novel thermo-catalytic NOx sensing mechanism through continued experimentation and testing. Increasing the number and type of catalytic sensing elements and integrating them into existing OEM packaging will allow us to measure NOx as well as other gases including ammonia (NH3). Sensor calibration equations and response lookup-tables will help validate our new method for NOx detection with successful results creating the foundation of a new category of sensors based on this differential detection architecture. Current automotive NOx sensors do not meet response time, accuracy and price requirements as used in the industry where such parameters are critical. The Phase II will optimize the optical sensing mechanism, and planned designs of experiment will help refine this technology into a reliable and robust device. Besides NOx and NH3, our "inorganic taste buds" also derive carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon concentration as a byproduct of the measurement process, thus providing additional utility for any combustion emissions control application.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop and commercialize radiation-tolerant

    Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and support services, will be semiconductor
    integrated device manufacturers and semiconductor foundries. In the CT scanner
    industry, improved radiation-tolerance of the electronics will allow key components
    to be placed directly in the X-ray path, improving signal quality, and resulting
    in better images at reduced X-ray dose levels to patients. Reducing X-ray exposure
    from CT scans is a medical priority, as it has been estimated that 0.4% of current
    cancer incidents result from high X-ray doses from CT scans.  Application of the
    patent-pending technology in radiation-hard ICs for a wide range of other commercial

    address the design, prototype and testing of a modular tension control device
    for individual tension regulation in the composite manufacturing sector. Composites
    are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and
    the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity,
    increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling
    tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality
    product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural
    integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have
    a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from
    composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance
    on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy.
    Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites.
    This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share
    of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing
    equally fast, if not faster. \n\nThis project will solve a problem that has plagued
    the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult
    (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with
    different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger
    products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited
    the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype
    and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The
    Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central
    base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the
    use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully
    tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype
    unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field
    trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production.
    In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements
    was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed
    and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase II project will fully develop and market a digital language tool previously found effective in helping non-native English speakers acquire language skills. It was found in SBIR Phase I that students using the tool improved their test scores both absolutely and relative to their peers. Spanish-speaking students learned more effectively when given native-language educational tools in multiple subjects. Competing educational tools are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. Consequently, more than 40% of non-native speakers drop out. If successful, this project will bring to a wider market an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation?s mission. Moreover, because schools face significant financial pressure to improve student achievement and because the product is competitively priced, it will be shown to be commercially viable, and a plan will be developed to expand the market for the tool outside of the state of California where it was initially studied.


    An expanding body of research has shown that language learners perform better on standardized tests when they can transfer their ability in another language (Spanish) to the acquisition of English. However, existing tools have not yet met this market need and focus instead on English-only instruction optimized for students who already speak natively. This project proposes to fully develop and market an existing language-acquisition platform found to be effective during pilot research in a large California school. SBIR Phase II research will address outstanding hypotheses suggested by Phase I results, and determine whether the tool can be easily adopted by stakeholders. Specifically, the impact of assignments chosen by teachers will be disambiguated from the use of the tool more generally, and the impact of English-only versus bilingual scaffolding will be studied in more detail to tailor the product to individual use cases. During Phase II, the product will also be integrated with existing academic systems and analytical software, and competitive per-seat pricing will be developed such that it can be marketed first within California and then nationwide by a network of resellers. A successful product will be measured by its effectiveness in closing the gap between native and non-native English speakers, at scale.

    Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a platform technology for detecting
    autoantibody markers for research and clinical diagnostics. Precision medicine
    requires the development of more powerful bioanalytic technologies to diagnose
    disease and direct targeted therapies. This platform uses a ligation-based DNA
    barcoding technology for improved antibody detection with increased analytical

    Additionally, as a solution-phase assay, it is able to detect numerous clinically-relevant

    Phase II project aims to develop the first solution-phase, ultrasensitive and
    multiplex antibody assay platform for the early detection, monitoring and treatment
    of human diseases. The Antibody Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) platform
    represents a major advancement in multiplex immunoassay testing. Many current
    multiplex technologies, such as microarrays and bead-based arrays, scale poorly
    due to cross-analyte interference, and lack the analytical sensitivity to detect
    crippling diseases at the most favorable time.  The Phase I results showed the
    expanded and validated ADAP technology for the ultrasensitive and multiplex detection
    of antibody biomarkers. The Phase II objectives are: 1) Validation of the multiplex

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in promoting clean energy technologies. More than half of the United States? greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation and electricity production. Lithium-ion batteries are a promising technology to facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable power generation that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the high cost of lithium-ion batteries threatens the commercial viability of clean technologies. This Phase II project will develop manufacturing process technologies that reduce the capital and operating costs of the most expensive step in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Low-cost batteries will push electric vehicles towards widespread commercial adoption. Electrification of mass-transit buses will improve urban air quality, especially for the low-income population located near bus depots. Large-scale battery systems enabled by low-cost batteries will turn renewable power generation such as solar and wind from periodic energy sources into on-demand energy sources to alleviate our dependence on fossil-fuels. This Phase II project will help lithium-ion batteries become a key technology in the successful departure from oil dependence, combat of climate change, and the United States? energy security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for deeper understanding of the fundamental science behind the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. SEI layer quality is a key determinant of long-term battery reliability, performance, and safety, but the underlying electrochemistry that governs SEI composition and evolution remains poorly understood. This Phase II project will develop novel, in-situ diagnostics to directly measure the evolution, performance, and characteristics of the SEI layer as it is formed during lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Deeper insight into the complex morphology of the SEI layer will advance much-needed industry knowledge of battery performance, quality, and longevity. Additionally, there is a sizeable body of work in modeling the degradation of batteries throughout their lifecycle. With improved cell-level traceability, the manufacturing insights enabled by this Phase II project will expand the current understanding of the ?ideal battery? at the beginning of life and complement ongoing work on how batteries degrade over time. This insight opens the door for quality control in battery manufacturing based on more direct quality metrics such as longevity and reliability rather than indirect metrics such as beginning of life capacity.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to facilitate understanding of cellular diversity in tumors, a phenomenon that contributes to acquired drug resistance. Quantifying and understanding this diversity may help predict a patient?s response to certain drugs which would allow the selection of ideal drug combinations for an individual patient?s tumor, thus enabling personalized medicine. This Phase II project will provide drug developers and researchers with a tool that can quantify diversity by correlating genetic and spatial information from tumors, providing crucial information about tumor composition that is currently missing today. This project will translate the technology into an efficient, high-throughput workflow that will enable commercialization with drug developers, researchers, and reference laboratories, generating both income and multiple job opportunities. The commercialization of this innovation will significantly impact scientific, corporate, and patient communities. Researchers will have a new tool improving drug development for cancer and other diseases, including Alzheimer?s and diabetes. Payers, such as insurance companies and the government, will save costs by eliminating unnecessary spending on treatments for patients who will not respond. Most importantly, patients will have broader access to personalized medicine through new treatments and screening methods that can help determine the optimum drug combinations for them.

    A single tumor contains multiple populations of cells that each have unique mutations, and it is necessary to understand the location and genetic differences of these cells in order to provide effective combination therapies that will not result in overall treatment failure or relapse. This Phase II project aims to provide drug developers, researchers, and physicians with a tool to correlate genetic and spatial information about individual tumors. Using a proprietary microfluidic device adhered to a standard microscope slide and tissue biopsy, incorporated with a laser-coupled microscope, this tool is capable of providing information that it is not possible to obtain from any other method today. Building upon the feasibility established during the Phase I project, Phase II will involve performing NGS to demonstrate the instrument?s usefulness in providing data for clinical research and biomarker discovery. It will also involve building a fully integrated prototype instrument with features that increase automation and throughput to make the technology economically feasible for commercialization. These developments will showcase the instrument?s value to customers as well as enable the commercial launch of a service.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development and demonstration of a new manufacturing technology for lightweight bio-based plastics.  Plastic produced from plant materials can have lower environmental impact than petroleum-based plastics, but price and performance issues have limited their adoption. In Phase I, Grow Plastics demonstrated the ability to produce lightweight, low cost, thermally stable 100% bio-based packaging products.  In Phase II, Grow Plastics will continue the development of its products while also working to develop a full-scale manufacturing line. The goal of the technology is to replace billions of pounds of petroleum-based plastic with a lower density plastic requiring half as much material, which is made from plants.

    This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to continue the development of a new manufacturing process for layered structures in biomaterials.  Grow Plastics has demonstrated the ability to generate novel, high-performance layered cellular structures in biopolymers in a new manufacturing process using new machinery.  The challenge in Phase II will be to continue the development in materials from Phase I while also scaling the technology to industrial scale.  Materials science and manufacturing techniques will include polymer blending, solid state foaming, and thermal crystallization of polymer blends. Analysis techniques will include tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry, thermo mechanical analysis, and evaluation of final product properties.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and replicable

    is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including:  Nutraceuticals,
    specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock,
    as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae can be used as a
    feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment.
    \  However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial
    potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical algal cultivation relies
    on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density
    algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements
    for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2.  In addition, the development of
    a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design
    will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise
    marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture

    and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale
    algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges
    in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased
    operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities
    will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for
    reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to
    maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus
    design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption;
    3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the
    need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder
    to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the
    basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater
    use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs.  The
    target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of
    sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to de-risk the volume manufacturability and reliability of thin crystalline power MOSFETs fabricated with a novel exfoliation technology demonstrated in Phase 1.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable lower cost and better performance for power devices in switching or transferring electricity under varying power requirements across the voltage spectrum in a variety of applications ranging from consumer, to communications, automotive and industrial applications.  In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness.  Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products.  A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry.  While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) High voltage high current characterization of the thin crystalline power MOSFETs (3) Process yield and reliability characterization of package thin crystalline power MOSFET parts and (4) Convert existing process line to use thin crystalline exfoliation technology in high volume manufacturing flow.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to develop a sensor with the ability to provide an accurate, small, cost-effective, and low-power device for the detection and quantification of natural gas. The current U.S. industrial natural gas leak detector market is estimated to be $325 million, while the residential natural gas detector market exceeds $2 billion, both of which indicate the strong market potential of this technology. Phage-based colorimetric sensing is a new sensing mechanism, and has the potential to replace and improve detection across many applications. This project, if successful, will have a number of broader impacts.  Firstly, 670 billion cubic feet (cf) of methane is leaked annually in the U.S. natural gas industry. Better monitoring and recapturing of the lost gas will result in less reliance on imported gas (3 trillion cf in 2015), thus stimulating economic growth and reducing waste.  Additionally, a new type of sensor that provides accurate, compact, inexpensive, and power-efficient natural gas monitoring with wireless communication capabilities will enable large scale natural gas emission monitoring studies, providing a tool for scientists and regulators.  Finally, a reduction of methane emissions will help combat climate change, as methane is a powerful greenhouse gas.

    During the Phase I project, we have successfully fabricated colorimetric thin-film sensors, developed a data analysis algorithm, and shown our sensors are both consistent and selective against individual components of natural gas at industrially-suitable sensitivity. In Phase II, we will further improve the production and performance of the phage sensors. There are six objectives in this Phase II project. The first is to do sensor calibration using precise gas calibration instrumentation to improve sensor accuracy. Secondly, the sensors will undergo environmental stress testing to evaluate longevity. Third, a scale-up feasibility study will be undertaken to determine and optimize sensor cost. The fourth task involves the development of improved and more inexpensive sensor designs, while the fifth task will optimize the production process of the new sensor. The sixth objective involves a more comprehensive characterization of the sensor.  It is anticipated that by the end of Phase II, we will have a precisely- calibrated gas sensor with data recognition algorithms, and an established and scalable manufacturing model, resulting in an improved colorimetric sensor development kit for natural gas that better meets customer needs in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes tremendous commercial potential, societal benefits, and scientific advances. Conventional superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are based on polyacrylates or polyacrylamides derived from petroleum feedstock. They are widely used in the absorbent cores of hygiene products, with disposable diapers representing approximately 85% of the global SAP market of $6B. Increasing consumer and supply chain demand for more natural, sustainable materials and products has driven the development of eco-friendly / natural labeled absorbent hygiene products (AHP). Eco-friendly diaper products currently make up about 3% of the global market and are experiencing strong growth at 10-15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This project will lead to the commercialization of a low-cost high-performance biobased SAP, offering significant environmental benefits as a more sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to petrobased SAP. This project could also generate positive economic impacts on domestic agriculture by creating new demand for bio-feedstocks such as waste glycerol. Finally, this project advances the scientific and technological state-of-the-art by developing a new bioprocess based on microbial co-cultures that could be extended to render more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other biobased fuels and chemicals.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a new biological route, based on microbial co-cultures, for cost-effective production of gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) and to commercialize cross-linked PGA SAP for AHP applications. In Phase I of this project, a microbial co-culture process was developed for efficient production of PGA via in-situ precursor production (ISPP) from low-cost bio-feedstocks. materials. Building on promising results in Phase I, further R&D will aim to reach pilot-scale production by the end of Phase II. Three specific technical objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Strain engineering and bioprocess optimization to develop an ISPP fermentation process with commercially viable performance metrics. Objective 2: Optimization of downstream purification, SAP cross-linking, and finishing to produce a high performance finished PGA SAP product. Objective 3: Pilot-scale process demonstration to produce commercial quantities of PGA SAP for large scale customer/partner trials. This R&D plan will lead to transformative technological outcomes. The proposed process based on microbial co-cultures represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial cost-savings. The engineering and process development strategies developed during this project will be transferrable for a broad range of other co-culture bioprocessing applications.

    This Phase II project aims to help address the achievement gap for English Learners, who consistently average 21% below native English speakers on reading scale scores starting in 4th grade and are twice as likely to drop out of school. Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners.

    This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language.

    This Phase II project proposes to develop a computer science (CS) educational software that has the potential to inspire millions of U.S. K-12 students to learn computer programming.  This software will leverage the motivational power of a popular video game, to teach CS to students by teaching them to reprogram the video game itself.  The United States currently has a severe deficit of students pursuing CS.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 1 million computing job openings will go unfilled by U.S. workers by 2022.  By leveraging the power of a popular video game, the technology proposed in this Phase II project has the potential to expose millions of K-12 students to coding in the next 5 years.  The commercial impact of the underlying technology developed in this Phase II project does not stop at the over 100 million users who currently play the popular video game with which the current educational software integrates.  Because the underlying technology is transferable to any moddable (i.e. reprogrammable) video game, the technology has the potential to be used to teach CS with other popular titles from the rapidly growing video game industry.

    This Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a software product that is a web-based coding environment for novice programmers.  This software goes beyond the state-of-the-art technologies in this space (i.e., scratch.mit.edu) in several ways: 1) It uses automated tutoring techniques to customize the educational experiences for novices, 2) it facilitates writing programs that manipulate objects and terrain in a 3D environment, 3) it allows the novice user to reprogram a popular video game, 4) it has an in-browser, WebGL-based 3D runtime environment, 5) it supports both a novice-friendly visual programming language (Blockly) as well as a text-based language (JavaScript), 6) it leverages gamification techniques such as badges, points, and unlockable items, and 7) it supports multi-user, collaborative coding.  The objectives of this Phase II project concentrate on improving student experiences in order to increase customer retention and acquisition and to finish the development of a marketable product that will teach 5 million K-12 students in the next 5 years.  The first objective of this project involves developing and extending the browser-embedded game engine.  The second objective focuses on improving systems that match students with appropriate educational content and motivate students to continue learning.  Finally, the third objective involves implementing new systems that incentivize students to create and share with the community.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve our ability to fight infectious diseases that negatively impact agricultural yields and reduce the efficiency of global food production and distribution systems. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.

    The proposed project follows up on the validation of the diagnostic platform (SBIR Phase I) and delves deeper into improving virus detection and genetic data generation. In addition, this proposal seeks to develop a basal informatics infrastructure that together with sample preparation improvements will be conducive of scalable, high-throughput analysis of several samples. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The SBIR Phase I was instrumental to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. In the pursue of standardizing and validating our metagenomics pathogen identification platform, this project proposes to: 1) improve viral detection capabilities and accuracy, 2) develop new functionalities, and 3) incorporate Phase I and Phase II advances into an integrated in-house web-accessible interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a dramatic increase in the security of modern computer hardware. This project presents a security verification software suite that detects security vulnerabilities in electronic hardware designs. Current state-of-the-art methods for detecting security vulnerabilities in hardware designs are very informal, consisting of security teams searching for these vulnerabilities through manual code review and committee discussion. This has already been shown to be ineffective in obtaining adequate security coverage, with security vulnerabilities remaining undetected and exploitable by malicious entities. With the unprecedented growth in the number of connected devices being developed for the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the number of security vulnerabilities will increase dramatically. The broader societal impact of this SBIR Phase II project is the increased security of computing systems, leading to more effective management of personal information and increased data privacy. The commercial impact is a unique software offering to semiconductor companies to help detect and prevent security vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise an IoT device. This greatly reduces the resources necessary to achieve high security coverage and eliminates long-term liabilities that can debilitate an entire company.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the technical development of a software suite for verifying security properties of hardware designs. The technology improves on the current methods in semiconductor companies that use manual audits in attempts to find security vulnerabilities in chip designs. It provides a systematic platform for verifying the security properties specified by the security teams on the actual hardware within these companies. This greatly improves the security coverage while reducing the time spent performing security audits. This SBIR Phase II project will develop the features requested directly by customers and perform the essential R&D efforts of the company's underlying information flow analysis technology in order to adequately solve customers' problems. The end result of this Phase II project will be a commercial grade product fit to detect and resolve security issues in modern electronic hardware designs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve light/heat control into the automobile and enhance user comfort by replacing existing automotive glass with dynamic automotive glass.  Economic and environmental benefits of using dynamic windows in automobiles include increase of miles per gallon by reducing air conditioning load with enhance light/heat management.  Replacing standard automotive sunroof glass with dynamic sunroof glass will increase fuel efficiency by 3 miles per gallon during summer time.  If all the glass in an automobile is replaced with dynamic glass then the impact will be much larger, resulting in decrease in oil consumption by several millions of barrels per day.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will utilize scalable solution processed techniques to create unique fast switching electrochromic layers. Current dynamic window technologies have not reached their market potential due to their high cost.  Due to technological limitations, current dynamic window products can only be used for sunroof applications as a result there are not being used for side windows, rear glass or windshield.  New class of electrochromic windows based on innovative materials and device designs that achieve fast switching, high contrast and low production costs will enable wide spread adoption of smart windows in a broad range of automobiles. The novel electrochromic layers developed during Phase I research will be improved further and scaled up to commercially significant size prototypes. New smart windows will cost 3-4x lower compared to current smart window products on the market or in advanced development stage.  These novel electrochromic devices will be thoroughly characterized and their long term reliability established by the end of Phase II research. At the end of Phase II prototypes of fast switching electrochromic automotive glazing will be built that are suitable for installation in a car for sunroof and/or side window.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a novel ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology that is economic, efficient, sustainable, and environmentally benign.  Current technologies, e.g., hydrocyclones, and membrane filtration, suffer from problems, such as high energy costs, use of consumables, fouling, and limited efficiency in separation of micron-sized particles.  The proposed technology does not generate waste, does not use consumables, operates at a low energy cost, and provides efficient separation for micron-size particles.  Ultrasonic standing waves are used to trap secondary phase particles in a fluid stream, when the acoustic radiation force exerted on the particles is stronger than the combined effect of fluid drag and buoyancy.  The action of the acoustic forces on the trapped particles results in agglomeration and/or coalescence of particles and droplets.  Heavier than water particles are separated through enhanced gravitational settling, and lighter particles through enhanced buoyancy.  During Phase I, successful prototypes were designed with a separation efficiency of more than 90% of a 1000 ppm emulsion at flow rates of 2500 Liters per minute.  Phase II focuses on the development of a system capable of processing 4 gpm, with fully integrated customized electronics, and testing of the system on real-world emulsions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the novel acoustophoretic separation technology provides for a cheaper and lower cost of energy separation of multi- component phase mixtures.  It can function as a drop-in replacement for conventional separation technology, such as hydrocyclones and other methods.   The societal impact is the development of separation technologies that are sustainable and environmentally benign since they do not generate any waste or use consumables.  Enhanced extraction of micron-sized oil droplets from water offer opportunities for enhanced oil recovery and oil-spill cleanup and reduce the emission of micron-sized oil droplets into the environment. This project increases the science and technology behind the use of acoustic radiation force on large volume flow rate. Full numerical models will be created to use in conjunction with experimental results. Dissemination of this work will be done by publishing our results in peer reviewed journals and conferences.  This project provides several internships to undergraduate engineering students, an opportunity to learn and practice engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship at a small start-up company.  FloDesign Sonics has a strong history and commitment to integrating undergraduate students in the development of their technology through offering internships and providing supervision for senior capstone design projects.

    This SBIR Phase II project will expand on Phase I R&D work to build, test, and optimize a web-based software system for the classroom setting to complement the digital library app for home use developed in Phase I. This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families.


    This project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age. The systems architecture and proprietary algorithms will produce a system that increases adult capacity for dialogic questioning and exploration by using the copyrighted, text-specific guidance embedded in the library. Metrics, children's work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs. R&D will include collection of engagement metrics, including usage data (access to which is built into the digital library) and online surveys. The core innovation to be studied is whether this product enables adults of varying educational backgrounds to practice an intellectually ambitious reading and thinking method with their children.

STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs are on the rise: the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that occupations in these sectors will grow by 8.9 % from 2014 to 2024. Yet the U.S. currently faces a critical shortage of workers and students who are proficient in math and science subjects. In part, this shortage is due to a lack of interest in STEM-related fields by minorities and women. Engaging, relevant and hands on experiences are needed to encourage interest amongst these populations. This project fulfills the requests of the federal government and leading-edge STEM educators that both secondary and post-secondary institutions teach science in a way that engages students with real-world problems. The expectation is that this project will make big data accessible, while providing rewarding and appealing hands-on learning opportunities that will increase data literacy; increase scientific collaboration in education across geographic and interdisciplinary lines; and increase scientific literacy and interest across demographics, thus increasing the likelihood that students will continue to pursue scientific careers.

    The proposed technology will be the first collaborative educational IoT STEM platform to be developed, and is innovative in the field of Educational Technology, which has yet to adopt web-connected sensors that generate big data on a global scale. At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data/curriculum. The platform's ability to promote greater learning will also be evaluated.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pilot field test controlled release polymers (CRPs) as an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation material. With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders.

    The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater.  To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of high application temperature materials available for additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US.



    This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing joints and cracks in cement concrete pavement, asphalt concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion/contraction when temperature rises/drops. Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate compatibility of a novel polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite coating with metal-polymer bearings currently on the market, scale up the coating deposition process, and implement pilot processing lines. Currently, there is a need for a method to improve adhesion at the PTFE/metal interface while also reducing corrosion, friction, and wear. The implementation of this technology will aid in the transition from traditional lubricants to solid lubricants in manufacturing and has significant implications for the US economy and the environment. Currently, annual lubrication-related maintenance costs are as high as $1 trillion, and consumption of petroleum-based lubricants is estimated to reach 43.78 million metric tons as of 2016. The effective implementation of this technology will reduce maintenance costs and downtime by eliminating premature bearing failure. This project will serve as a proof point for the adoption of nano-coating technologies for reducing friction and wear in mechanical systems. It will also reduce barriers to entry for these coatings in industries dominated by outdated lubrication practices. The total applicable market size for metal-polymer bearings is estimated to be $1.0 billion, and a substantial near-term revenue opportunity for the proposed technology in this sector will be the focus of this effort. This beachhead opportunity serves as an industry validation point for the proposed technology and an entry point to other industrial and manufacturing applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project is based on improving the adhesion and mechanical properties of PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings using an adhesive biomimetic polymer. This technology increases the wear-life of PTFE coatings, allowing for applications from which they have historically been precluded due to high wear and delamination. During Phase I, the proof of concept was established through demonstration of strong adhesion, 40% reduction in friction, 80% reduction in wear and elimination of susceptibility to corrosion in current metal-polymer bearings. The focus of Phase II will be in tailoring the coatings for specific product applications and implementation. The proposed SBIR Phase II work will overcome the remaining technical hurdles and validate the use of this technology as both a solution for improving the adhesion between PTFE and substrates and as a replacement for current PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings. The execution of this project will allow the realization of critical proof points needed by industrial partners and speed the adoption of this technology into product lines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new carbon dioxide utilization technology for the commercialization of onsite gas production. The impediment to electrochemical carbon dioxide utilization technology has been the lack of an electrolyzer design capable of high production rates and high energy efficiency. This project will yield a novel electrolyzer component to overcome these challenges and demonstrate that cost-effective carbon dioxide utilization is possible. This component can be integrated into existing electrolyzer designs, and will enable such hardware to convert carbon dioxide into specialty gases. The resulting solution will have higher safety and lower cost than conventional packaged gas. Long term, this technology could be scaled up to higher volume applications, and used as a means of converting industrial carbon dioxide emissions into useful chemicals and fuels, thereby transforming a waste product into a new revenue stream. This scalable technology could therefore be the basis for the creation of new economic value and advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, while providing a profitable way for existing U.S. industries to reduce their emissions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to increase the performance of a novel carbon dioxide electrochemical cell along key performance dimensions, in order to deliver a commercially-relevant, cost-competitive solution. A viable solution to derive specialty gases from a low-cost feedstock like carbon dioxide will need to have high performance on several dimensions: energy efficiency, high reaction rates, long lifetime, and low capital cost. It will also need to operate at a scale that is industrially relevant. In Phase II, the novel electrochemical component will be scaled up to commercial dimensions, and the performance of the component will be optimized to meet the performance requirements identified during customer interviews. The final component will form the basis for a commercial unit, capable of producing specialty gases from carbon dioxide at cost-competitive rates. It will lay the foundation for future scale-up to even larger membrane areas, which will enable industrial-scale applications of this carbon dioxide conversion technology. Carbon dioxide emissions could be converted into valuable products using this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enhance infrastructure for research and education by exposing a previously unavailable dataset: fine-grained human interaction with a physical environment. Humans are always building on and shaping the world but there is little hard data to further examine the effects this has. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society by increasing economic efficiency because retailers can meet customer needs more easily. This translates into large potential commercial value because of the size of the retail market and because retailers are under pressure to deliver differentiated customer experiences that customers cannot get online or at big-box stores. Such experiences are enabled by understanding the customer at a much deeper level which in turn is enabled by the technology proposed here.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses sensor placement models, statistical methods, and face recognition to fully realize the commercial potential resulting from the Phase I development of a video analytics system for understanding human behavior. Research in video-based behavior recognition has seen renewed excitement because of deep learning but current work only addresses pieces of the problem. Critical missing components are robust face identification and registration, a process to install as few cameras as possible while maximizing the viewable area of a store, and video analysis results that are meaningful when combined with other data such as retail transactions. The research objectives of extracting biometric data (such as facial features) from video, automatically computing the optimal positions of cameras, and correlating behavior metrics with business operations are essential to improve the retail experience for shoppers and make the developments undertaken in Phase I more commercially relevant to potential end users of the technology.

    the development of the next generation of contact lenses for vision correction
    based on a novel photomodification technique called \"LIRIC (Laser Induced Refractive
    Index Change).\" More than 2.3 billion people world-wide suffer from refractive
    error in their visual system, while over 500 million have inadequate access to
    refractive correction. Glasses are an option for refractive correction, however
    there can be practical limitations and even social stigma associated with wearing
    glasses, particularly among adolescents. Meanwhile vision correction with contact
    lenses is limited to lenses whose optical prescription is determined by their
    thickness profile. This has negative consequences for visual quality, on-eye stability
    and corneal health. The research represents a fundamental shift in how vision
    correction is applied because it alters the refractive index of an optical material,
    enabling previously unavailable visual correctors in thin, stable contact lenses.
    LIRIC uses a high repetition rate, femtosecond laser to micro-modify the local
    medium to produce custom refractive corrections in hydrogels, and in living cornea.
    LIRIC works by accumulating localized refractive index (RI) changes in an ocular
    material to create a refractive lateral gradient index lens. \n\nChanging the
    refractive index using LIRIC instead of the surface shape can lead to several
    fundamental advances for vision correction, with profound implications for vision
    care: 1) contact lenses can be manufactured specifically for patient fit and stability
    with the refractive correction decoupled from the lens shape; 2) difficult and
    irregular refractive corrections (i.e. for irregular astigmatism, presbyopia,
    and higher order aberrations) could be written more easily and with better spatial
    resolution than with existing methods; 3) multifocal and diffractive optical designs
    can be utilized for presbyopic and macular degenerative corrections. Patients
    viewing through LIRIC lenses, created in Phase I, had visual performance (visual
    acuity and contrast sensitivity) on par with a control lens. The objective of
    the Phase II work is to demonstrate that LIRIC works in contact lenses at process
    speeds necessary for commercial manufacturing. The goal of this work is to demonstrate
    that a 6.5 mm optical zone can be successfully processed in <15 seconds. To effectively
    do so, the LIRIC process has to achieve more than 1 wave of phase change (at 555
    nm wavelength) at laser scanning velocities in excess of 10 meter/second."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel algorithms for electrodynamic simulations in commercial clouds. Electrodynamic simulation is essential for computational prototyping in optical and radio-frequency devices. Current commercial solutions require significant upfront investment of both software and hardware. They also suffer from low productivity due to limited in-house computing resources. This project will develop a cloud-based simulation service which will provide on-demand, pay-per-use, virtually unlimited simulation capability without requiring users to purchase any hardware or software. This simulation technology will greatly improve productivity, reduce the barrier to entry, and minimize cost in the design of optical and radio-frequency applications. Moreover, it will serve multiple scientific and engineering disciplines and will facilitate the use of high-performance simulation in all phases of scientific discovery and engineering design. It will revolutionize large-scale scientific simulation and allow anyone with internet access to gain unprecedented simulation power. Ultimately, this technology will help accelerate research and development in the health, energy, and defense industries by offering intuitive, on-demand, and practically infinitely scalable scientific software to engineers and scientists at a price-point significantly lower than any other cloud computing service.

    There is currently no electromagnetic simulation software which performs efficiently in commercial clouds, because they were written under the assumption that the underlying computing platform is homogenous and has low inter-CPU communication time, i.e. low latency. Starting from the most fundamental level of space-time discretization, we will develop the first electrodynamic simulation software that is latency-tolerant and cloud-optimized. The work completed in Phase I developed several proof-of-concept cloud-based electrodynamic solvers and demonstrated that commercial cloud computing platform is a viable option for offering extremely low cost computing. The general solver to be developed in Phase II will serve a broad set of applications, and will be commercialized as the electromagnetic simulation service in the cloud, featuring a fully immersive web-based visualization interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a probiotic treatment that may be used to reduce or eliminates Salmonella and other infections in poultry. The recent FDA Veterinary Feed Directive will result in the use of antibiotics being phased out of livestock production. New technologies are needed to control pathogens in the absence of antibiotics. The goal of this technology is the reduction of pathogens in pre-harvest poultry, which may result in safer food and reduced foodborne illnesses.  In addition, this technology may help reduce the amount of antibiotics used in poultry production, which has been cited as a major factor in the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

    This SBIR Phase II project will result in the development of novel antimicrobial technologies using probiotics engineered to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. During Phase I, probiotics were built successfully and tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be provided to animals safely in their food or water.  The antimicrobial probiotics will be used to test the reduction of pathogens in poultry guts. Pathogens in poultry guts are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. The engineered probiotics will use synthetic DNA promoter regions that are designed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection.  The impact will be examined in field trials of probiotics with controllable AMP delivery on poultry challenged by Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni, two common foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial probiotics also will be tested against Clostridia perfringens, the causal agent of poultry necrotic enteritis, an illness that causes billions of dollars in productivity losses every year in the US.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims
    to develop a MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS)-based radio transceiver providing
    a steep reduction in operating power for wireless data transmission in battery-powered
    devices. Conventional technology offerings for such radios are numerous, but with
    10's of mW of power consumption they are unable to operate for long periods on
    batteries or scavenged power. If the low power radio promised by MEMS technology
    is realized, battery life of consumer products such as wireless headphones can
    be greatly extended, and battery size reduced, saving money and increasing convenience
    to the end user. With the spread of compact wearable and consumer devices, battery
    space is becoming increasingly at a premium, strongly incentivizing lower power
    electronics. As this technology matures, the expanding interconnection of devices
    (aka, the Internet of Things) offers yet greater potential. With rapidly expanding
    market adoption of wireless connectivity for sensing, control, and data collection,
    power consumption is becoming a major limiter in device deployment. If lower power
    transceivers are available, wired devices may be replaced by wireless and battery
    replacement cycles reduced or even done away with altogether, saving time and
    money, and paving the way to true interconnection of all things. \n\nThe work
    of this Phase II SBIR project will focus on designing and verifying performance
    of the MEMS-based radios using fabrication processes suitable for mass production
    and commercial distribution. By combining MEMS technology with traditional circuit
    design, the proposed system will enable a 10x reduction in power consumption,
    low enough that these radios will allow extended operation on battery power alone.
    In the phase I project, the feasibility of the MEMS-based receiver was tested
    using resonators compatible with currently available MEMS foundry processes, and
    power consumption of the core radio-frequency transceiver components was verified
    at a low 300 mW. In phase II, these results will be expanded upon to add the additional
    transceiver components and software stack needed for a complete commercial product.
    The resultant design will be then transferred to the commercial foundry processes
    needed for mass production. The end goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete
    MEMS-based radio compatible with the widely-used Bluetooth Low-Energy protocol
    while operating on a total of only 2 mW in receive-mode."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will continue development of a non-resorbable surgical film which prevents internal tissue-attachment. The proposed device will improve post-surgical outcomes from patients who suffer from internal tissue-attachment triggered by cardiothoracic or neurological surgery. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for developing unwanted tissue-attachment due to trauma as a result of surgical intervention. This tissue-attachment can lead to severe complications and increase the burden of post-operative care resulting additional expenditures through extended hospital stays, readmissions, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, undesirable tissue attachment can obstruct the surgical field upon re-operation when necessary. Surgical related tissue-attachment is a problem amongst many surgical procedures in a number of areas. However, cardiothoracic and neurological procedures are often more complicated than gastrointestinal or gynecologic procedures, making any complications more expensive and risky to providers, payers and patients. Additionally, re-operations in cardiac or neuro-spine cases are extremely difficult, which underscore the need for an effective solutions to prevent this malady even more urgent. A product that can effectively prevent undesirable tissue-attachment and provide the surgeon with a clear surgical field and plane of view would be highly desirable in both cardio-thoracic and neurological surgery.

    The proposed project will conduct additional pre-clinical work leading to a regulatory submission for a cardio-thoracic indication and additional validation within the neurological field. Positive animal studies completed during Phase I & IB efforts revealed the capacity of the Sintact Film? to reduce tissue attachment and provide for a clear field of view upon re-entry or re-operation. Initial Phase II work will examine the feasibility of scaling-up certain manufacturing and production processes resulting in a clinical grade product which will undergo sterility, safety, animal, biocompatibility, and mechanical testing. This testing will be compared directly to a predicate or equivalent approved medical device. Results will need to show equivalency of the Sintact Film? to the predicate device across all testing metrics. Additional Phase II work will enable further validation of the Sintact Film? for neurological indications. A larger definitive neurological study will be completed to address the capability of the Sintact Film? to be deployed effectively in a neurological setting. Positive results from this study will provide a basis for pursuing expanded indications and additional market opportunities. If successful the implications that a non-resorbable product can be an effective countermeasure in these areas would alter the current methodology in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to combat modern day slavery in the United States and Canada. In this project the company will go beyond the public sector, selling its capabilities to the hospitality industry, which shares a role in tackling this problem. Banks also play a part in detecting financial transactions which stem from criminal revenue streams. These new markets expand the revenue opportunity and social impact of the technology. The proposed Phase II research and development will solve huge challenges voiced by the company's law enforcement users. The deployment of these research products through a platform that enables evidence management and collaboration will accelerate the impact by increasing communication among the fragmented law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States. This will enable agencies to conduct more effective investigations, and empower them to take on larger cases involving organized crime across state lines. Finally, human expertise will be developed within the company and through its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to commercialize advanced computing research for real-world, social impact. These innovations will empower more victim rescues and exploiter prosecutions. The project will create a culture within the company to nurture engineers in social entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will expand on machine learning technology created in Phase I to deobfuscate escort ads and implement end-to-end innovations for investigations. Each day, there are thousands of online data points related to prostitution. Hidden behind this content are victims of sex trafficking, those forced or coerced into sex work, including juveniles who have not reached the age of consent. Big Data presents the opportunity to seize this information to disrupt traffickers and organized groups who drive the cycle of exploitation. The company's research objectives include maximizing evidence recall using sophisticated crawlers and deobfuscation methods, as well as generating leads using natural language processing and multi-modal machine learning. The project will further develop computer vision capabilities to interpret features of an image and enable visual search for missing victims. It will formalize methods for collecting ground truth, preventing false positives, and diagnosing algorithmic performance relevant to users' needs. Finally, the company will deploy this research into accessible software products that provide real-time, digestible, and actionable information to law enforcement, resulting in the rescue of hundreds, or potentially thousands, of sex trafficking victims.

    of data to users and control systems. This project addresses major barriers in
    our main market, the application of IoT to the buildings sector, where complexity
    is encountered in the placement and powering of sensors in monitoring locations
    where access is limited. By reducing the upfront and maintenance costs of wireless
    sensor networks, the project allows cost-effective building sensor data collection
    of unprecedented longevity and density. These rich data sets in turn enable myriad
    benefits, including more effective building management controls and in-depth automated

    environmental sensor would enable high-granularity sensing, feedback, and control
    to several additional markets including industrial, agricultural, and any other
    market application that would benefit from monitoring where power or access is
    in short supply. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
    focuses on developing a low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental monitor
    using commercially available components and standard processes. An energy harvesting
    sensor of this type is not available commercially, and is uniquely enabling for
    building energy auditing and controls, supporting a new generation of automation

    installation or battery maintenance. This device was developed through Technology
    Readiness Level (TRL) 7 in Phase 1 of the SBIR program, in parallel with supporting
    data infrastructure, including dynamic cloud databases, data access via API methods
    and a beta data visualization platform. Phase II of the program aims to expand
    the scope of the low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental sensor from
    a network of low-power, short-range devices to a plug-and-play building-wide sensing
    solution, which includes the incorporation of additional hardware elements, including

    develop copper based pastes for the metallization of silicon solar cells. Photovoltaics
    (PV) offer an opportunity for clean and affordable energy and over the past decade
    the PV industry has seen annual compound growth rates of over 50%. Although revenues
    are high, the profit margins for many manufacturers have substantially diminished,
    necessitating the need for cutbacks throughout the value chain. One area marked
    for cost reduction, is in the metallization of the solar cells, which now commands
    nearly 10 percent of the world's supply. Having the cost of photovoltaic panels
    tied to a precious metal with price volatility can lead to higher prices for renewable
    energy; thus replacing silver with copper is a significant opportunity for the
    industry. Thus the outcomes of this project would be a product for making solar
    energy more affordable. The project also includes creating two new full time positions
    in Kentucky in Advanced Research and Manufacturing. This proposal will enhance
    scientific understanding of the copper-silicon contact formation and durability
    of the material during operation. \n\nThe technological feasibility of the copper
    pastes with an inherent diffusion barrier was demonstrated on standard and bifacial
    solar cells in Phase I. Phase II will further improve the screen printable pastes
    to industry standards. To achieve the high electrical performance required in
    this market, the project will investigate the copper-silicon interface to investigate
    the mechanisms involved during contact formation, and the chemical nature of the
    copper-silicon interface. This information will be used to optimize the chemical
    composition and thermal treatment of the pastes to improve electrical performance
    and cell lifetime. The pastes will be optimized for industrial operating equipment
    to provide the manufacturer with a product that can be dropped in, with minimal
    changes to the production line. Phase II will also involve scale up of the core
    materials in the pastes to be able to engage customers in further printing trials.
    Through the assembly and testing of prototype solar cell modules, the durability
    of the copper contacts will be demonstrated. The outcomes of this proposal will
    be screen printable copper pastes that can be direct drop in replacement for the
    silver pastes; thereby enhancing the profit margins of the solar cell manufacturer."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is far-reaching in terms of improving the quality
    of life and the cost/efficacy of healthcare for more than 20 Million people in
    the USA. We address the need for better methods for identifying and guiding the
    treatment of ambulatory patients with dangerous heart dysfunctions such as intermittent
    arrhythmias and heart failure. For example, atrial fibrillation arrhythmia afflicts
    nearly 8 Million patients in the USA, approximately 460,000 new patients every
    year, and the patient load is projected to grow to 12.1 million by 2050. The disease
    and its complications (stroke, congestive heart failure, seizures, death, etc.)
    add $26B to the nation's annual healthcare costs. Heart Failure currently afflicts
    nearly 5.7 Million people in the US growing to 8 Million by 2030. Their treatment
    and frequent hospitalization costs are already at 14B$ and will grow to 29B$ by
    2030.  Together with reducing the economic impacts, it would be of an enormous
    benefit to human health to create a device that improves the diagnosis and guides
    effective therapy for these patients while they remain fully ambulatory and going
    about their normal activities outside the expensive confines of the hospital.\n
    \ \n\nThe proposed project has the following intellectual merits. In our Phase
    I STTR program we focused on developing a wearable Atrial Fibrillation monitor
    to assist physicians in the diagnosis of paroxysmal or episodic versions of that
    disorder. In Phase II we have pivoted towards the even more critical need of ambulatory
    monitoring of paroxysmal tachycardia and eventually heart failure patients. The
    current industry standard of ambulatory ECG does not provide enough sensitivity
    or specificity to determine if the patient has atypical or typical atrial flutter,
    paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia as well as various forms of ventricular
    tachycardia. Accurately diagnosing and monitoring these disorders is critical
    to patient treatment and outcomes. Our device will be capable of ambulatory patient
    monitoring for any sort of arrhythmia, and we believe it can be the preferred
    choice for all portable monitoring if it provides in one device ECG, heart motion
    and breathing rate/pattern/volume. So, the overarching technical research goal
    of our Phase II work is to develop a full featured prototype cardiac motion sensor
    as described above that can be used for initial clinical tests. These features
    include: wearable, battery powered, signal storage, cardiac motion from radar,
    disposable antenna, onboard ECG, and breathing rate."

    implement a proprietary rare earth extraction process on recycled NdFeB magnets
    at pilot scale to prove commercial production feasibility. By recovering rare
    earth elements (REEs) readily available in waste streams, this effort will help
    create a secondary source of these critical elements, thereby reducing U.S. dependence
    on an unstable, limited supply from China. This will, in turn, lay the groundwork
    necessary for the production of cutting-edge technologies reliant upon these materials
    to return to the U.S.  The Nd and Dy elements which are recovered from this process
    are the critical components that increase the efficiency of electric motors by
    up to 30%. The availability of these resources will also significantly improve
    the vertical integration of manufacturing for national security technologies that
    depend heavily upon REEs, such as guided missile actuators and jet-fighter control

    a new, reliable revenue stream for electronics recycling companies.\n \nThe process
    to reclaim REEs from NdFeB magnets is simple and energy-efficient, with a minimal
    environmental footprint. The Phase I SBIR project demonstrated the feasibility
    of developing the process beyond laboratory scale to pilot scale, improved the
    purity of the end product and reduced the amount of waste from processing.  The
    Phase II project will focus on the following objectives: 1) designing a scale

    scale production process; 3) maximizing product recovery at pilot scale; 4) designing
    a wastewater treatment and reuse strategy; and 5) minimizing residual contamination

    process parameters for maximum yield, maximum purity, and minimum processing times
    at pilot scale. The first stage will be to successfully obtain production yields
    of 90+% and purity levels of 99+% in pilot scale batches. For the second stage,
    we will focus on scaling production to prove commercial-scale feasibility, with
    ideal product yields and purities of 95+% and 99+% respectively. Throughout all
    stages, we will focus on understanding and treating the accompanying waste products,
    including wastewater and residual metal impurities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is to produce economically the next generation of sustainable, renewable, clean burning, high energy density, transportation biofuels. The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production.

    The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast.  Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project is to produce a better natural gas treatment membrane that will allow end users to capture the ease of processing and environmental advantages of membrane technology at a substantially reduced price.  Natural gas processing to remove CO2 and other contaminants is the largest industrial gas separation application with an estimated global separation equipment market of approximately $2-3 billion per year. At present, membrane processes have a 10% market share, while amine absorption processes account for the bulk of the market.  Conventional membrane materials are limited by their relatively modest CO2/CH4 selectivity, which offsets their environmental and efficiency advantages. The novel perfluoro polymer membranes developed in this program show enhanced performance when treating gas mixtures at industrial relevant conditions.  Study of these perfluoro polymer membranes will improve scientific understanding of structure/property relationships for a new family of materials.  Most importantly, applied at a commercial scale, these new perfluoro membranes offer the potential to overcome the limitations of prior membranes, and thereby, transform natural gas processing.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to complete the development of novel perfluoropolymer membranes for use in natural gas CO2 removal. During Phase I, membranes with superior CO2/CH4 separation performance compared to commercial membranes were identified in comparative high-pressure mixture tests. In Phase II, the research and development plan is to scale up production of the most promising perfluoro polymer.  An optimized membrane based on this polymer will be made on a roll-to-roll production line and fabricated into membrane modules. These modules will be evaluated in laboratory parametric experiments and validation tested at an operating natural gas field site.  Results from these tests will be used to update an economic evaluation of the perfluoro membranes compared to conventional technology applied to natural gas CO2 removal.  Completion of these technical objectives will bring this advanced membrane technology to the cusp of commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.

    This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the "green-revolution," dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of "release-ready" varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

    The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project, in which a non-invasive respiratory muscle stimulation
    device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation will be developed,
    is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity
    for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation
    each year in the US. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications
    (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually,
    a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current
    reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at
    the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively
    benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In
    addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle
    physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our
    technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms
    for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by
    the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare
    reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a
    considerable commercial impact.  \n \nThe proposed project will develop a non-invasive
    electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory
    muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach
    is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory
    muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting
    ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that
    have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional
    prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.
    \ The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize
    its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system
    so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will
    be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand
    its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype
    will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for
    clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable
    a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the
    device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

    adaptive online learning platform founded on the principles of adaptive learning.
    The online learning system provides adaptive learning strategies with real-time
    learner analytics. The system integrates learner analytics from four dimensional
    aspects of learning: multi-media, learning strategies, interactivity, and social
    interaction-- to deliver a personalized learning experience for science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) students for significant improvement in the learning
    outcome. The adaptive learning software technology platforms with personalized
    learning strategies have demonstrated high completion and satisfaction rates for
    online students taking post-secondary courses. In this SBIR Phase II we propose
    to develop a unique data driven decision support interface that will result in
    real-time big data analytics for both individuals and large numbers of learners.
    The volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (the 4 Vs of big data) will be generated
    by the collection of data at individual schools first, with the potential to aggregate
    data from district, state, and even national levels.  The big-data analytics of
    the learner trajectories through the adaptive learning platform will uncover patterns
    that can improve understanding of learner behavior in education.  \n\nBig data,
    generated by the adaptive learning systems related to learner behavior in each
    learning strategy, will lead to valuable insights on efficacy of the proposed
    methodology and further development of the product on mobile platforms in the
    Phase II.  The learner analytics will provide the basis for intelligent feedback
    based on the statistical evidence.  The proposed method of data driven decision
    process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical
    analysis of the predictor variables for an individual learner.  The field trials
    of the proposed method will be conducted in the participating high schools.  Collection
    of data for a group of students collected during the field trials in high schools
    will lead to discovery of learning patterns for the clusters of learners in each
    learning strategy. The previous Phase I research has led to the development of
    an analytical model for volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data collected
    at school-wide level.  This reports form this data is used for the development
    of decision tree and regression analysis to find correlations (knowledge discovery)
    that can be used for the improvement of learning enterprise (school). The data-driven
    feedback to students and the group analytics for teachers will provide necessary
    feedback mechanism for improving competency and graduation rates for STEM education
    in schools and colleges."

    public speaking skills and prepare students with better oral communications skills
    necessary to perform job tasks. Oral expression is the most highly valued ability
    throughout the economy and ranks as the second most highly-valued skill for high-wage,
    high-growth, high-skill occupations. Approximately 4.5 million college students
    take a basic communications course each year, however, as class sizes get larger
    and online learning becomes more common, public speaking instruction becomes increasingly
    difficult.  Practice and feedback are essential aspects of these courses, yet
    it is a struggle for teachers to find enough time to sufficiently interact with
    students. This SBIR project aims to develop the key concepts of automated public
    speaking assessment such that a student?s vocal delivery can be objectively measured
    and presented in a manner that creates an independent, personalized learning experience.
    Unlike traditional methods of public speaking assessment, the proposed system
    can be available at any time, provide objective feedback and track student practice
    and improvement. The proposed Software-as-a-Service is projected to generate $16
    Million in revenue over five years and create more than 25 high-paying, US-based
    jobs. \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes
    to develop an automated assessment system for public speaking that determines
    how a speaker would be perceived by an audience.  Automated assessment for speech
    has already occurred in spoken language proficiency, which leverages Automated
    Speech Recognition (ASR) and semantic analysis. Automated voice assessment has
    also been utilized in lie detection and emotion detection, which focus on autonomic
    responses in the user?s voice, such as when stress affects the vocal cords. The
    hypothesis behind this SBIR project is that speakers can consciously use and modify
    non-semantic speech behaviors to produce more desirable listener perceptions.
    Automatically linking listener perception to speech behaviors represents a novel
    direction in automated assessment for speech. The Phase II objective is to develop
    software sufficient for automated public speaking assessment such that a student?s
    vocal delivery can be objectively measured and presented in a manner that creates
    an independent, personalized learning experience. Voice analytics capability investigated
    in Phase I will be enhanced and developed into a cloud-based service which helps

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate advancement in high-mobility materials.  These materials are being increasingly used in the electronics device industry.  This project's goal is to enable better devices by providing complete data on the effects of manufacturing processes and better enabling their optimization.  Innovative electronic device structures such as faster computer chips, and more powerful RF circuits require development of smaller and smaller devices employing more advanced materials.  The innovation that is being advanced through this Phase II program directly impacts this development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a deployable system to directly measure high-resolution mobility, resistivity, and carrier concentration profiles for high-mobility semiconductor materials.  Current electrical profiling methods provide partial data for these material systems that form the basis of the multi-billion dollar semiconductor logic device and RF/power chip industries.  The objectives of this Phase II program are to further demonstrate a prototype by developing and integrating high-reliability sub-systems to build a beta-level measurement tool with nm-level resolution.  This is expected to reduce the semiconductor wafer area needed to evaluate high-mobility materials, and develop the measurement capability to target all high-mobility materials with potential applications in IC and RF/power industries.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development and scale-up of a manufacturing
    platform for producing bio-based chemicals for application in lubricants. This
    manufacturing platform will utilize biologically derived sugar carbon-source and
    transform this carbon to higher value products via microbial fermentation. In
    contrast to the complex mixture of fatty acids currently produced in the oleochemical
    industry, the technology developed in this project will deliver a product stream
    containing simpler mixtures of monounsaturated fatty acids, which will eliminate
    the costly separation cost and be directly used to synthesize cost-efficient high-performance
    lubricants. Due to the improved lubrication performance of these molecules, this
    technology will potentially increase the energy efficiency of industrial and transportation
    machinery. By utilizing biological carbon feedstocks and producing bio-degradable
    products, this technology has the potential to reduce the environment footprint
    of the lubricant industry. More beneficial impacts are anticipated as we expand
    the application of monounsaturated fatty acids into other industries, such as
    surfactants and polymers. A large commercial potential of this technology has
    been identified in the lubricant market, currently valued at $123B per annum,
    and predicted to grow to $178B per annum in the next 5-years. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project proposes to develop technology that will deliver novel bio-based monounsaturated
    fatty acids that provide new chemical structures allowing innovations in lubricants
    not possible from petroleum-based raw materials. Based on successful development
    of bacterial strains capable of producing enriched monounsaturated fatty acids
    in the Phase I project, the Phase II project will further de-risk the technology
    and scale up the capability to produce sufficient quantities of monounsaturated
    fatty acids to be evaluated by potential customers.  By optimizing and scaling
    up the fermentation process and developing the product extraction procedure, large
    quantity of the first generation product (55% enriched monounsaturated fatty acids)
    will be produced. It will be used to chemically synthesize high-performance lubricants
    (i.e., polyol esters), whose physical-chemical and tribological properties will
    be evaluated and provided to potential customers. In this project, metabolic engineering,
    system biology, and evolutionary strategies will be applied to further improve
    the strains for producing second generation products that are more enriched in
    monounsaturated fatty acids (70-80%) and achieve commercial viable technology
    metrics. The monounsaturated fatty acids are envisioned as platform chemicals
    for subsequent chemical conversion to numerous specialty chemicals that have applications
    in additional markets, such as surfactants and polymers."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the environmental impact of Aluminum production. Global production of aluminum from bauxite ore currently accounts for 1% of global electricity consumption, and 2.5% of CO2 emission. Over the last 15 years global production has doubled, and is expected to continue to increase over the next decades with expanded use in automotive applications. To meet increasing demand while reducing the environmental impact of production requires cost effective means of removing contaminating metals such as iron from aluminum. Commercial application of the technologies investigated here would positively affect the global aluminum industry and reduce its environmental impact. Applied to conventional primary production, the technology can be used to increase the yield from bauxite, or allow kaolinite clays to be used for primary production. The former will reduce the environmental and economic costs of production, while the latter would allow domestic producers to reduce their reliance on imported bauxite. If the technology is applied to primary production using carbothermic reduction, the impacts on the global aluminum industry would be even greater. Greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by up to 50%, and electricity consumption reduced by up to 20%.


    The objective of this Phase II SBIR research is to demonstrate a cost effective barrier centrifuge technology to remove contaminating elements from aluminum alloys. In the Phase I research we demonstrated the basic technology using a liquid gallium alloy instead of aluminum. In Phase II, we will fabricate an apparatus for handling liquid aluminum and characterize its purification efficiency and costs to own and operate. Using the barrier centrifuge to purify aluminum in secondary production would reduce the need for dilution by primary aluminum, thereby reducing the demand for the primary aluminum with a consequent reduction in electricity consumption, greenhouse gas production and waste disposal needs from the bauxite refining process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to improve cleaning in the food processing industry by integrating hyper-stable enzymes into cleaning products. Industrial enzymes are a growing, multi-billion dollar green industry that reduces energy, water, and harsh chemical use while improving process efficiency in many sectors. Despite the broad use and success of industrial enzymes, their application and economic impact has been severely limited by narrow thermal and chemical operational ranges available. The company has developed heat and acid stable enzymes that significantly expand the reach of enzyme applications. The goal is to develop an initial product for the dairy cleaning market that will have the potential to increase production due to faster cleaning, achieve better removal of protein contaminants and biofilms, reduce water usage, and reduce food product exposure to chemicals and chemical waste. Better cleaning with enzymes has the potential to prevent food-borne illness, and decrease water use, while increasing food-processing profits and providing a biodegradable alternative to chemical cleaners.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using the first practical protein expression platform to produce hyperstable enzymes for commercial use. Although the genes from extreme organisms have been studied for over forty years, their commercial potential has not been realized due to their incompatibility with traditional protein expression systems. The unique hyperstability of enzymes produced using the company's technologies indicate that enzyme stability is not encoded entirely by gene sequence. In Phase II, the goal is to develop more comprehensive cleaning formulations and test these with laboratory and field trial methods established in Phase I. The project encompasses a set of integrated experiments spanning molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, dairy processor field trials, and practical industrial bioprocess optimization. The aim is to transform the world's most extreme enzymes into the world's most effective products for membrane defouling and sanitation in the dairy industry and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to offer custom crafted digital voices for text-to-speech applications. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the paint and coatings industry with new high-performance, cost-competitive polymer/resin systems that reduce solvent emissions and use of petrochemicals.  In addition, these new polymer/resin systems enable one-component, ambient-cure coatings to be produced.  This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings.  The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person.  Compared to the current state-of-the-art in one-component, ambient-cured resins, these new polymer/resin systems provide dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness, while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and flexibility.  The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, while their low solvent emissions and high renewable content will reduce impact on the environment.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to: 1) further optimize the polymer/resin systems to produce compositions that minimize solvent content and maximize performance, while meeting the cost constraints of the market; 2) put in place a pilot-line to provide potential customers with adequate sample sizes to enable their own evaluation of potential products, 3) generate weathering, corrosion, and storage/shelf stability data to further understand the application potential of optimized polymer/resin systems; and 4) optimize the polymer/resin production process to minimize cost and minimize production waste.  By meeting these objectives, the Phase II project will result in the generation of new polymer/resin systems that will enable the development and commercialization of new paints and coatings that are one-component, ambient-cured, low in solvent content that exhibit exceptional properties, while being primarily based on renewable materials.  Optimized polymer/resin systems will be provided to potential customers for their own internal evaluation.  If necessary, feedback from customer evaluations will be used to modify polymer/resin system composition to meet customer needs.  By the end of the Phase II project, the technology will be ready to proceed to manufacturing scale-up and product commercialization.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to
    deliver a cost-effective automated quality control (QC) system for manufacturing
    of radioactive drugs used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This system will
    replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments,
    6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance
    on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in
    radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction
    of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate
    adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing
    a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical
    production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today,
    this solution is positioned for rapid adoption.  After adopting this system, it
    is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction
    and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance
    associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption
    rate.  This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology,
    an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry
    and diagnostics.  \n\nThis Phase II effort includes four technical objectives.
    \ Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume.
    \ Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value
    which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2
    ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range
    trade-offs.  Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption
    by a commercial manufacturer.  Current plastic prototype components are only suitable
    for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel.  To reduce the amount of training
    required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component
    will be designed in order to further automate sample loading.  Third, we will
    optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for
    the consumable kit.  The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains
    unknown.  Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate
    the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to
    enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the
    newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to produce a new type of computer memory called Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM). FEDRAM is cheap and can be mass-produced in current semiconductor manufacturing facilities. It also uses much less energy than current-state-of-the-art memories, and enables electronic devices to be much smaller in physical size. Commercially, FEDRAM works best as an embedded memory, which means they are ideally suited for products such as mobile phones where the processor and memory are on the same chip. Additionally, the same block of FEDRAM can be configured for high performance applications in addition to longer storage applications. This means that future devices will adapt to maximize power, performance, and usability. Due to the factors of price, performance, and low power, once FEDRAM is proven to work, it can potenitally be adopted in nearly every electronic device.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the commercialization questions of Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM).  In SBIR Phase I, it was shown that FEDRAM cells can be manufactured in an existing foundry with no new materials or equipment changes, and that FEDRAM has leading performance characteristics. The next step is to prove the same characteristics in an array, which would be considered a minimum viable product; this is the goal of SBIR Phase II. By proving this array,  it will be possible to quickly scale the FEDRAM memory array into embedded applications for commercial deployment.  The performance characteristics to be demonstrated are read/write latency, switching time, endurance, retention, and energy use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and produce a robust, hand-held, video-rate three-dimensional surface metrology system with vertical and lateral resolution of several micrometers, in order to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces.  Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations.  Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians.  Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.

    During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.  This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size.  Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback.  A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the creation of commercial viability for 3-D printing unique ceramic structures by transforming 3-D printing of advanced ceramics into mass-production additive manufacturing.  This will be a new capability for the US. The 3-D structures being considered can't be easily made with traditional manufacturing techniques but have significant advantages over traditionally manufactured geometries. If 3-D printed structures could be manufactured economically, the societal impact could be tremendous ranging from creation of hundreds of US manufacturing jobs to reduction in CO2 emissions. Commercially viable products that can improve existing markets and enable new markets are realistic expectations. Structures for improved filtration, catalytic production of clean fuels, H2 reformers, emission controls for stationary fuel cells, and CO2 sequestration have been inspired by Other Equipment Manufacturers and are already being jointly developed as a result of Phase I progress. Interestingly, these products and more could be produced from the same product lines just by changing a computer program. This great efficiency of infrastructure is a fortunate trait of additive manufacturing. In short, this project will position Robocasting Enterprises as a US exporter into world-wide markets for economic and societal benefit.

    This project is based on foundational technology called robocasting for 3-D printing ceramic materials.  Robocasting is an additive technique demonstrated to be useful for rapid fabrication of ceramics into advanced lattice structures for enhanced filtration and catalytic performance.  However, robocast products have been largely limited to products with dimensions less than 2 inches because of problems related to cracking. The goal of this project is to make additive manufacturing much more commercially viable for ceramics by: (a)  overcoming the technical challenges for robocasting large ceramic parts and; (b) designing and implementing a scaled-up manufacturing line commercially competitive with traditional manufacturing processes and production from low-wage countries. To achieve these goals; materials, processes, and equipment improvements are required.  Developments will include:  1) material innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 2) processing innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 3) equipment and automation innovations to increase production rates. At the end of Phase II it is anticipated that rapid manufacturing of large (i.e., 5-10 inch) advanced ceramic lattice structures will be demonstrated to be commercially viable and penetration into several markets will be significant.  The technology will be perfectly poised for investment from larger companies and Phase III growth.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to advance the state of knowledge and industrial practice toward cleaner, cheaper, greener steel and stainless steel.  The project will focus on the production of iron, part of a $1.1 trillion annual market worldwide, and ferrochromium, a $2.2 billion worldwide annual market.  Molten oxide electrolysis with an inert anode has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale to produce low-carbon iron and ferroalloys, which are the basis of many high-performance steels.  The current low-carbon metals sell at a premium.  Published cost models show that both the capital and operating cost of MOE will be lower than competing technologies already in the marketplace.  MOE can also reduce the environmental impact of producing these metals, even with today's electricity, and can produce even greater improvements with renewable energy.  In summary, MOE will produce primary metals of higher quality at a lower cost and with lower environmental impact than current methods.

    The objective of this Phase II research project is to develop a cheaper, more energy efficient route to production of important metals including iron and ferrochromium. Economical separation of these metals from their ores by molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) is enabled by the recent invention of an inert anode material. The essential next step in understanding the behavior of the new inert anode in MOE is longer-duration testing than was possible in the laboratory cell. This test can only be achieved at a larger scale. The models and testing on surrogate systems in Phase I have shown the way to provide this long-duration testing in Phase II.  These tests will point the way toward industrial-scale production of iron and ferrochromium by MOE.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to greatly enhance the capabilities of printed electronics via high performance conductive materials.  This will be accomplished by the development and commercialization of novel silver and copper ink chemistries that are used in a number of device applications ranging from display bezels and interconnects, to high performance OLED electrodes, to ink specifically developed for high speed printing and smart packaging applications.  The commercial impact of such developments will be the significant adoption and use of printed electronics material palettes across multiple consumer electronic device platforms.  This will ultimately lead to more efficient device manufacture with a simultaneous improvement in performance.  The printed electronics market is rapidly growing with progress hinging on fundamental material improvements.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate scalability of reactive silver ink chemistries, formulations for productization standards, and development of reactive copper ink chemistries.  The reactive silver ink chemistry has begun to receive significant traction with customers.  This program plans to achieve scalability of this high performance ink by novel purification of silver salts to achieve a high conductivity at large scales with industrially relevant processes.  Next the inks will need to adhere to specific productization standards.  This includes modifications of the chemistry for various printing processes ranging from low viscosity (10 cPs) up to high viscosities for high-volume printing techniques (1000 cPs and higher).  Also, modifications to the chemistry for various testing criteria such as adhesion, abrasion, and environmental tests such as humidity and heat cycling will be made.  Finally, reactive copper chemistries will be further developed.  Copper inks that can be processed thermally in the ambient environment represent both a significant challenge as well as a vast opportunity in the printed electronics market.  We have developed novel chemistries based on various low molecular weight reducing agents and short-chain surfactants that both reduce the copper quickly under thermal cycling while protecting the surface from oxidation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. Using current methods, the oil industry is able to extract only 5% of the known hydrocarbon from shale formation. This represents more than $500B of potential oil and gas that cannot be economically produced for the US economy. The aim is to increase the efficiency of oil production by providing novel subsurface information to improve operational decision making. The resulting value increase for a producer can be up to $1M per well. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing process, which is currently only 50% efficient. By providing novel subsurface data for the industry, this information can reduce environmental impact by saving up to 45B gallons of fresh water and 1M rail cars of mined sand. Furthermore, the analysis of subsurface microbiomes is a rich area for new academic knowledge.  Over 80% of the microbial strains identified in Phase I have never been documented in public references. This work not only provides economic and social value, but also expands scientific knowledge.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use next-generation microbiome analyses to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. The research objective is to analyze the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs and leverage this new data source to increase current efficiency rates. The goal is to analyze 50 producing wells in the Southwestern US, and develop statistical models linking microbial profiles to key reservoir properties that can increase production efficiencies. The analytical method employed will utilize technology stemming from over $20 million in government funding to the University of Colorado used to create bioinformatics software known as "QIIME."  The QIIME technology has been extensively tested in analyzing and modeling the human microbiome, but has never been applied to the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome prior to the Phase I work.  By combining advances in cloud computing, DNA sequencing, and novel software analytics, this project will demonstrate that these microbial communities correlate to meaningful production parameters for the oil and gas industry. In so doing, the project will demonstrate at pilot scale that this new information source can be utilized as a novel, non-invasive, low-cost reservoir characterization tool that allows the industry to maximize hydrocarbon production while minimizing environmental impact.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development of a nanoparticle characterization instrument that will fill the critical unmet need to rapidly and accurately measure the size and distribution of nanoparticles from 30 nanometers to 1 micron. Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences.

    This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations.  In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    focus on developing the process required to produce fiber reinforced polymer (FRP)
    rebar at scale.  FRP rebar offers significant performance advantages when compared
    to uncoated steel rebar.  These advantages include a sevenfold weight reduction,
    no corrosion - which in turn permits a 30% reduction in concrete usage (and a
    corresponding 15 billion ton reduction in CO2 emissions) - and equivalent tensile
    strength at smaller diameters compared to steel rebar products.  FRP rebar is
    being produced but has limited market acceptance due to its high cost.  The high-speed
    process to be developed in this project will allow price parity when compared
    to uncoated steel and enable a hundredfold improvement in process speeds compared
    to current FRP manufacturing.  Combined, these improvements will allow entry to
    the $140 billion global market for steel rebar and allow mass market adoption
    of FRP rebar.  Additionally, basalt mine waste will be explored and, where possible,
    utilized as a raw material for fiber production.  The broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project includes job creation and environmental impacts.  With
    implementation of this process up to 35 manufacturing jobs can be created immediately.
    \ \n \nThe company's high speed process combines a thermoset resin and basalt
    fiber as primary reinforcements within the FRP composite.  A consortium of pultruders
    has collectively organized the Fiber Reinforced Polymer Rebar Manufacturers Council
    and has developed FRP rebar into a viable product over the last 20 years, with
    a $1.2 billion market at present.  Currently, no FRP rebar product is offered
    at price parity with uncoated steel rebar, and to reach this price parity a high
    speed process has been invented.  This novel process will be optimized and further
    developed by the completion of this Phase II SBIR project.  Basalt fiber, an emerging
    material with the potential to replace carbon and other fibers in a variety of
    applications will be brought into large-scale industrial usage with the completion
    of this project.  The Phase I project permitted the determination of the performance
    characteristics of thermoset resins which have not been commonly used in pultrusion,
    enabling product validation.  This Phase II project will address a range of manufacturing
    challenges that will be encountered in the production of FRP rebar at industrial
    scale, allowing a commercially viable final product that can be offered at price
    parity with steel rebar."

    the development of an ultralow-power ultrasonic three-dimensional (3D) rangefinder
    system for mobile gesture recognition. The proposed 3D rangefinder uses an array
    of tiny piezoelectric ultrasound transducers which are built on a silicon wafer
    using microfabrication techniques. Custom electronics are used to control the
    transducers and the system emits sound into the air and receives echoes from objects
    in front of the transducer array. The proposed ultrasonic 3D rangefinder has the
    potential to be small and low-power enough to be left on continuously, giving
    devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearable electronic devices a way to
    sense physical objects in the surrounding environment. Based on the smartphone
    market alone, the potential market size for this device is over one billion units
    per year.  Mobile contextual awareness will enable 3D interaction with smartphones
    and tablets, facilitating rich user interfaces for applications such as gaming
    and hands-free control in automobiles. Looking beyond the smartphone and tablet

    are to transfer the ultrasound transducer manufacturing from a university laboratory
    to a commercial production facility, to develop a custom integrated circuit for
    signal processing, and to develop engineering prototypes. In Phase I, micromachined
    ultrasound transducers having a novel structure designed to improve manufacturability
    were developed and a demonstration prototype was built using signal processing
    algorithms running on a personal computer. In Phase II, the ultrasound transducers
    will be manufactured in a commercial facility for the first time and signal processing
    algorithms will be realized on a custom mixed-signal integrated circuit. A prototype
    package for the transducer and integrated circuit chips will be developed and
    detailed acoustic testing of the packaged prototypes will be conducted."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is development of a microbial technology for the conversion of low-value sugars into high-value chemicals. Most industrial chemicals produced today are derived from petroleum and other nonrenewable raw materials. The long-term growth and sustainability of the chemical industry benefits from development of new routes to existing chemicals using renewable raw materials. Furthermore, due to higher infrastructure costs and stricter environmental requirements, many chemicals that were once produced in the United States are now produced abroad. This contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. This Phase II proposal aims to develop a fermentation technology where domestically grown agricultural materials (for example, corn and waste agricultural residues) are converted into high-value chemicals. The optimized fermentation process is estimated to be cost-competitive with the incumbent petrochemical route when scaled. If successful, this proposal will facilitate growth of a domestic bio-chemical manufacturing industry, targeting the $30 billion organic acids market.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop large-scale, high-throughput techniques to optimize gene expression in industrial yeast. A significant problem within the field of industrial biotechnology is the ability to engineer and optimize the fermentation performance of non-academic or model microbes. Most molecular metabolic engineering tools are developed for use in two model prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and are not suitable for use with industrially relevant microbes. Without these tools it is costly and slow to commercialize new fermentation technologies. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop and implement a set of molecular biology tools designed for acid-tolerant yeast, and working to apply them toward improving small molecule production. Specifically, the molecular biology tools are useful for tuning (up- or down-regulation) user-defined gene transcription and translation. Engineered microbes harboring the desired genetic modification(s) are assayed for improved small molecule production from sugar in small scale fermentations. Successful genetic modifications are those that result in more efficient small molecule product formation from sugar, and ideally decreased biomass formation from sugar, providing a lower production cost in a scaled, commercial process.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project is the sustainable production of high-value lipids (oils,
    waxes and fatty acids) from abundant and inexpensive feedstocks. The process is
    based on a unique lipid- accumulating microorganism found in Yellowstone National
    Park that is capable of directly converting a wide range of feedstocks such as
    wheat straw, corn stover, and industrial by-products (e.g. molasses, glycerol)
    to valuable lipid products such as Omega-7 fatty acids and high-melting temperature
    waxes. Renewable oils, waxes and fatty acids have significant demand in a wide
    range of industries (e.g. neutraceuticals, biolubricants, cosmetics, candles and
    soaps). Consumers will clearly benefit from this technology through the reduction
    of our dependence on petroleum-based products while generating a market for agricultural
    wastes and by-products. Since few companies and research groups are investigating
    fungal lipid production directly from lignocellulosic biomass for higher- value
    products, both industry and the scientific community will benefit from the knowledge
    gained by this research. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
    project describes a simple, novel and cost-effective process for converting lignocellulosic
    and other waste feedstocks to high- value lipids using a microorganism isolated
    from Yellowstone National Park, which is capable of withstanding extreme acidic
    conditions and producing powerful enzymes for degrading cellulose, lignin and
    hemicellulose. The organism accumulates high concentrations of valuable lipids
    in a cost-effective ?one-step? process. The produced lipids based on renewable
    resources creates a market for waste agricultural materials. The primary objective
    of this SBIR project is to further develop the process for commercial production
    of lipid products from waste organic feedstocks. Phase II efforts will focus on
    optimizing the process with a bench pilot-scale system, performing process flow
    design and techno-economic analysis of commercial production systems, analyzing
    lipid products in detail, and targeting appropriate markets/customers for the
    produced lipid products. Coming out of the Phase II program, the goal is to have
    a pilot- level demonstration system designed to produce economically viable yields
    of high-value lipids from a variety of substrates for defined target markets and
    customers."

    at optimizing production of a bio-surfactant in preparation for commercial launch
    of the product.  During Phase I, the company developed an engineered microorganism
    that synthesizes the surfactant, and a key customer confirmed the identity and
    purity of a sample of the surfactant.  During Phase II, synthetic biology methods
    will be used to increase the efficiency of the microorganism producing the surfactant.
    \ In addition, multiple samples of purified surfactant will be shipped to customers
    for evaluation.  Customer feedback will identify any product features that require
    modification and will result in development of a detailed product specification,
    which will include metrics such as:  purity, color, acceptable variation in composition
    and molecular weight, etc.  The objectives of this Phase II project are to optimize
    surfactant characteristics and microbial production efficiency so that the surfactant
    can be profitably manufactured and sold for use in consumer products formulations.\n
    \ \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it should
    enable the company to demonstrate that synthetic biology methods can be used to
    increase the efficiency of production of a bio-surfactant so the surfactant can

    research and development aimed at commercial launch of additional bio-surfactants.
    \ Benefits to society are that chemicals produced using this technology will be
    manufactured using domestically grown renewable raw materials, which do not compete
    with food.  Furthermore, the energy required to produce these chemicals is low
    since the fermentation reaction is performed near ambient temperature.  The chemicals
    are inherently safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not
    used, and the surfactants are biodegradable and do not contribute to increased
    greenhouse gas accumulation.  These bio-surfactants will initially be used in
    personal care products, such as body washes and shampoos.  However, the surfactant
    market is large and diverse, creating an opportunity for use of bio-surfactants

    high specific surface area as the support for protein adsorption ligands. Compared
    to competitive products (e.g., packed resin beads or microfiber adsorption membranes),
    these nanofiber membranes/felts will provide greatly enhanced throughput (i.e.,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives and to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require larger, more complex models to be built. Organizations will need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that scale with these demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. This project will address the resource management challenges identified in development and the interactivity gaps identified in user testing of the Phase I prototype. The result will be a commercial software application for building models that manages code, data, and the evolution of both over time by many users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on bringing enhanced independence, productivity, and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US who live with severe physical disability due to spinal cord injury or other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Due to improvements in emergency medicine and increasing average age, these individuals represent a growing population that is underserved by current assistive technologies (ATs). The ATs being relied upon to carry out basic tasks are still primitive, offer limited versatility, and fail to meet end-user needs. Meanwhile, computers and internet play ever-growing roles in everyday life and are regarded as equalizers that allow individuals to have similar vocational, recreational, and educational opportunities. The Tongue Drive System (TDS) offers individuals with severe physical disabilities an intuitive and superior mechanism for accessing computer-based resources, wheelchairs, smartphones, smart homes, etc. TDS harnesses the power of the human tongue, which often retains full capability in these individuals despite losses of other functions, to drive human-computer interactions. TDS has the potential to revolutionize the current AT market in the US and around the world with an anticipated market size of $1B within its primary market segment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project aims to bring this transformative and game-changing AT to market by continuing the design, development, evaluation, and expansion of a robust, reliable, and real-time TDS ecosystem. In Phase-I, the TDS hardware was redesigned and consolidated so that all signal processing functions were self-contained into a new standalone TDS (sTDS) headset system with a dual-band wireless link that can directly interface with a target peripheral by transmitting formatted user-defined commands. In Phase-II the designs for a solid and intuitive user interface, a smartphone app, and a robust and rugged powered wheelchair interface module to effectively control key target devices will be fine-tuned in the final stages of development in preparation for launch. The sTDS hardware/software/enclosure will also be tested and ready for manufacturing and meet the FDA regulatory requirements towards submission of a 510(k) premarket notification.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the proposed cybersecurity tool can allow organizations to audit their big data usage to prevent data misuse and comply with various privacy regulations. Recent attacks have shown that the leakage/stealing of stored data may result in enormous monetary loss and damage to organizational reputation, and increased identity theft risks for individuals. Furthermore, in the age of big data, protecting the security and privacy of stored data is paramount for maintaining public trust, and getting the full value from the collected data. The company's proposed tool will potentially have significant impact by addressing these important societal needs with respect to big data security and privacy. Based on customer discovery findings, this tool will also address an important customer need found in many different industries and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool that provides efficient data sanitization, attribute-based access control, accountability and governance policy enforcement capabilities for protecting sensitive data stored in big data management systems. In addition, the proposed product will provide novel data sensitivity aware intrusion detection capabilities. The Phase II research objectives are: 1) to develop an efficient attribute-based access control framework to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data; 2) to develop data sanitization capabilities for complying with various regulations; 3) to develop a scalable audit log capture, storage and querying framework for increasing accountability for big data usage; and 4) to develop a data sensitivity aware intrusion detection framework to quickly detect potential attacks against sensitive data. These objectives pose significant research challenges with respect to scaling to big data without impacting the existing workflow of the companies. The company proposes to address these challenges by using novel code injection techniques combined with risk aware audit log generation and data sensitivity aware machine learning based intrusion detection techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to search and understand documents across domains. It is a powerful tool for consumers and businesses to route, categorize and ensure key points of a document are seen. This makes it easy for overwhelmed users to search, link topic information to knowledge bases and extract customized data, even if they can't think of the right keywords.  Online search can infer the popularity or relevance of a page based on data from millions of users, including a user's location and what they've shown interest in; however, business users don't benefit from these features. Users view concepts in a summary linked to a knowledge base, allowing them to see summaries, triage documents on mobile devices, write rules to sort or filter them automatically, and see key data before ever opening the document.  This Phase II project improves information extraction systems by generating answerboxes from complex documents. Consumers will be able to quickly get the gist of formal documents such as consumer credit contracts, insurance policies, industry solicitations, engineering and other difficult-to-read documents. This innovation advances knowledge discovery, information retrieval methods, information extraction, slot-filling, and knowledge-base population.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project discovers unsupervised and unrestricted slots and fillers (attributes and values) to construct structured summaries based on keywords and underlying patterns in document collections. It extends the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Additionally, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. This approach further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process. This concept-linking enables terms to explicitly map to semantic concepts in other ontologies such that they are available to enable reasoning and understanding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable Unmanned Aerial Systems
    (UAS or drones) to safely and reliably operate from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea.
    There is an immediate need for this capability in many industries. In commercial fishing, drones
    will replace manned aircraft for fish-finding operations, radically reducing cost and risk. In maritime
    security, drones will provide surveillance around ships, including locating a ?man-overboard? in
    time to save the person?s life. In the oil and gas industry, drones will provide rapid-response to oil
    spills by mapping the location and extent of the oil slick, limiting the environmental and economic
    damage. In hydrographic surveying, drones will identify and geo-locate navigation aids, at a
    fraction of the time and cost of current survey methods. In commercial shipping, drones will
    inspect and protect shipping vessels while they are underway. In the transport industry, drones
    will delivery packages the ?last mile? from a delivery truck to a customer?s door. In law enforcement
    and border security, drones will operate from moving patrol vehicles while officers remain safe
    and mobile in the vehicle. These applications are currently difficult or impossible, but will become
    radically safer and easier with the proposed technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will advance the current state
    of the art in UAS/drone autonomy, to enable reliable drone operations from moving vehicles and
    moving vessels at sea. Shipboard landing is extremely difficult, due to the heaving and rolling of
    the ship deck, potential high winds, and the high precision control required during landing. Current
    drone technology does not facilitate landing on moving platforms; this prevents their use in
    maritime operations, and has become the main barrier to commercialization in this sector. The
    proposed research will develop a vision-aided relative navigation system that combines precise
    air-to-ship observations with onboard sensor measurements to accurately estimate the relative
    state between the drone and the ship. These relative state estimates will be used to dynamically
    route and control the drone safely on to the ship deck. Technical feasibility of this approach has
    been demonstrated during the Phase I project, which included demonstration of the technology
    in a relevant environment. The primary goals of the Phase 2 project are to improve system
    reliability, expand the operational envelope, and productize our system. The plan to achieve these
    goals includes scientific development paired with extensive testing, validation, and demonstration.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses low student engagement through a dynamic video delivery environment with a novel, real-time algorithm that adjusts the instructional pathway to each student's readiness level. According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.



    The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a manufacturing platform for opioid
    medicines. Opioids enable physicians to provide compassionate care to patients
    suffering from acute or chronic disease and trauma. The need for opioid analgesics
    is even more salient for surgeons anticipating the post-operative recovery of
    their patients and planning for end-of-life care. However, opioids are highly
    addictive medicines, a property that has been exploited for commercial gain by
    certain players in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of this project will
    be to deliver a technology that transforms the existing supply chain for opioids
    by removing the need to grow opium poppy as a drug crop. Instead of sourcing poppy
    materials from poppy-growing countries, this new technology will allow for complete
    production of opioids in a secure industrial facility located in the United States
    where federal agencies can provide oversight and regulation. Additionally, investment
    in this technology will enable the development of many more existing and experimental
    medicines derived from plants, including greatly improved opioids with improved
    efficacy and safety, and cardiovascular and chemotherapeutic therapies that will
    extend and enhance human lives.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop
    a bioprocess for opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To date, the
    only commercially-competitive method for manufacturing opioids and related alkaloids
    is to extract these molecules from plants. However, Baker's yeast was recently
    engineered to biosynthesize opioids, which is a technological advance that could
    enable opioid production by fermentation. However, many technical hurdles remain
    in developing a reliable and cost-effective, commercially-viable production system
    based on existing strains. The objective of this Phase II project is to provide
    a complete demonstration and pilot-scale operation of an API bioprocess that is
    ready for industrial scale up. The research employs four approaches: 1) Further
    development of the engineered yeast strains, 2) scale up of fermentation from
    laboratory scale to pilot scale, 3) optimization of downstream recovery and purification,
    and 4) evaluation of the resulting products to establish their validity as drop-in-replacements
    for existing opioid APIs. The outcome will be a process validated at pilot scale
    and ready for technology transfer to a secure industrial facility that will make
    and sell into the opioids API market. This research will replace opium poppies
    with a modern bioprocess that resembles established, standardized pharmaceutical
    industry methods for antibiotic and biologic APIs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to develop and commercialize an extendable/retractable telescopic structural wall for flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses
    a new class of chemosensor films to continuously measure the concentration of
    heavy metals in a flowing stream of industrial wastewater. This will make it possible
    to know the concentration of several heavy metals at any given time so that treatment
    chemicals used to remove those metals can be metered precisely.  Current treatment
    methods typically rely on infrequent sampling of wastewater streams and time-delayed,
    labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Without the ability to measure continuously,
    wastewater treatment is adjusted based on periodic averages and estimated peak
    discharges.  To reduce the risk of regulatory violation, most wastewater treatment
    systems use twice the volume of treatment chemicals than might otherwise be needed.
    \ With the ability to measure metal concentrations continuously and automatically,
    wastewater treatment can be controlled in real time, cutting treatment chemical
    costs, solid waste costs and measurement labor costs by more than 50%.  Continuous
    measurement also reduces the risk of regulatory violations by > 90%, in turn reducing
    the potential costs of remediation and compliance as well as improving environmental
    conditions for the general public.     \n\nThe key outcome of Phase I research
    was the successful development of 15 new chemosensors permanently bound to a substrate,
    each with a unique response to zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper,
    iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel and tin. In Phase II, responses from
    an array of chemosensors will be fully characterized with a prototype instrument
    developed for commercial use in different industrial environments.  With that
    instrument, a mathematical model will be constructed to accurately convert sensor
    responses into scientific units of measure for multiple dissolved metals. The
    lower limit of detection for existing sensors ranges from 5 ppb to 50 ppb.  In
    parallel with analytical modeling work, chemosensor synthesis work continues to
    lower the limit of detection to 1 ppb, extend sensor life beyond 6 months, and
    broaden the portfolio of sensors to improve metal selectivity.  In the future,
    this new class of bonded chemosensors may be extended to determine the concentration
    of phosphates and many other species that are currently sampled occasionally and
    measured with lab instruments.  For applications where continuous measurement
    is important, this unique family of chemosensors offers great potential for real-time
    process control in a variety of industrial applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the bandwidth crisis, the problem of transmitting an exponentially growing amount of data through a fixed amount of increasingly congested spectrum. The bandwidth crisis limits economic growth by constraining communication, and also poses very serious challenges for national defense and disaster response. Making better use of limited spectrum is therefore of high societal and commercial importance. This project will study a new approach, called spiral modulation, for achieving much more spectrally efficient communication than previously thought possible and thereby directly addressing the bandwidth crisis. Commercially, this could facilitate much more rapid data transfer, enhancing existing business applications and enabling new ones. Spiral modulation is applicable to any form of electromagnetic communication, whether wireless or wire-based. It could lead to commercialization across a wide range of communication sectors including but not limited to wireless, mobile internet, unmanned vehicles, automotive, aviation, and Internet of Things. It is a dual use technology with both civilian and defense applications. Ultimately, spiral modulation could become the core technology for the worldwide telecommunications industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project applies new mathematics to the problem of encoding information into waveforms for telecommunication. In current digital communication, information is transmitted using symbol waveforms constructed from sinusoids which have constant amplitude over each symbol period. This approach is known to produce a sharp upper bound on the highest spectral efficiency that can be achieved. By instead constructing symbol waveforms from sinusoidal waveforms with continuously-varying amplitude, spiral modulation bypasses the theoretical limitation on spectral efficiency. Building on prior Phase I research, this project will build an end-to-end hardware prototype to establish the implementation path and performance characteristics of spiral modulation. The research will progress in stages from waveform design and spectral efficiency measurement experiments, through end-to-end radio design in software, the hardware prototype development and documentation of best practices. It is anticipated that this research will show significant spectral efficiency advantages over existing signal modulation techniques. Other possible advantages for spiral modulation may also appear, such as greater tolerance for interference and phase distortion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the
    development of non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving clinical
    outcomes following spinal fusion surgery. Between 1998 and 2008, the annual
    number of spinal fusion surgeries increased 137% from 174,223 to 413,171 and the
    national bill for spinal fusion increased 7.9-fold. The greatest risk in spinal fusion
    procedures is failure to fuse, which can be particularly troublesome in high risk
    patients. Failure to fuse leads to poor surgical outcomes for patients and may result in
    chronic pain, secondary surgical procedures, reduced productivity, and/or permanent
    disability. In addition, failure to fuse results in greater clinical burden for physicians
    and increased cost per patient for payers. Lumbar fusions, in particular, have a
    cumulative reoperation rate of 19% over the 11 years following the initial procedure
    (BCC Research, 2010). The present project could result in the identification of new
    surgical devices and techniques capable of improving surgical outcomes, reducing
    complications, and eliminating costs associated with unsuccessful surgery. Osteogenic
    surgical device and techniques developed in the present project may also be used to
    accelerate bone healing and improve clinical outcomes following fractures of the skull,
    face, and long bones.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is to
    demonstrate in an animal model that osteogenic spinal instrumentation accelerates
    new bone formation and improves the rate of posterolateral fusion compared to
    clinically-accepted best practices in spinal fusion surgery. Innovative osteogenic spinal
    instrumentation (pedicle screws, rods, etc.) facilitates both mechanical stabilization of
    the spine and focused delivery of fusion-stimulating direct electric current (DC) at the
    fusion site. Application of therapeutic stimuli via selectively anodized pedicle screws
    accelerates the rate at which new bone is formed in critical regions of the spine such
    as the zygapophyseal joint and lateral gutter. The propensity of newly formed bone to
    create a robust, biomechanically sound fusion of adjacent vertebrae is also increased
    under osteogenic stimulation. Phase I results demonstrate that selectively-anodized
    electroactive pedicle screws effectively deliver focused osteogenic stimuli to key
    regions of the lumbar spine critical to spinal fusion. Results provide computational
    evidence for the technological and clinical success of novel osteogenic
    instrumentation in spinal fusion surgery. Phase II will confirm that the system of
    electroactive spinal instrumentation has the potential to accelerate bone growth and
    improve post-surgical fusion outcomes compared to gold-standard interventions
    utilizing a clinically relevant large animal model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project stems from addressing the problem of embedded energy in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving fuel economy by incorporation of the lightest structural metal, magnesium, does not save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional methods. The most energy efficient and economical production method is known is a process technology that was commercially viable during World War II but not at any other time in history. The project innovation reinvestigates and reinvents this dated process, discovering the reasons for technical and economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using state-of-the-art energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream manufacturers that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium and steel production, and canned beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium metal over the past 100 years. This innovation creates a clean and economic route to magnesium production, helping to reinvigorate light metals industries within the U.S.

    The intellectual merit of this project is derived from a new paradigm in the condensation of magnesium metal gas produced by carbothermal reduction of magnesium oxide. Previously, shock cooling through a meta-stable temperature range was employed, generating pyrophoric powders that are dangerous and difficult to handle. This Phase II research uses both rapid cooling and controlled heterogeneous condensation for the formation of robust, oxidation resistance magnesium condensate. This process is executed in a novel and continuous condenser for high metal throughput. This effort is also made possible through the development of a reduction reactor technology that operates under milder conditions than previously used while maintaining high production rates. Total plant energy consumption will be at least 50% less than the dominant incumbent process. The Phase II project will result in a scaled ore-to-ingot pilot facility for the manufacture of magnesium metal as a raw material into manufacturing processes. Product quality, process feasibility, and proven scale-up will be demonstrated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from technology for automatic network configuration analysis.  As ever more devices connect to the Internet and rich services move to the "cloud," both the complexity of computer networks and their reliability requirements are rapidly escalating. It is no wonder that network outages and security breaches are common.  Yet another side effect of this complexity, which does not make the headlines but is equally damaging, is that network engineers are understandably fearful of making configuration changes, so networks are unable to evolve at a speed that keeps up with changing business needs.  The technology developed in this project will enable network engineers to validate correctness, security, and performance properties of their networks proactively, before errors reach the running network.  This technology has the potential to improve the robustness of critical network infrastructure that is widely relied upon, to prevent unauthorized access to resources, and to increase the pace of innovation.  The project will also provide insights into the largest "pain points" in modern networks and develop design and analysis techniques to address them.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project further develops the Batfish network configuration analysis technology.  Interactions with pilot customers as well as many interviews with potential customers identified the needs of the marketplace and how the Batfish technology can best be adapted to meet those needs. As a result, the specific goal of this project is to seamlessly aid network engineers in validating network behavior during the policy design phase. Drawing inspiration from how software is developed today, the company will extend Batfish to support continuous integration of network configurations and develop a series of analyses that can find errors in network configurations with minimal input from the network engineers. The anticipated outcome of these research thrusts is a technology that allows network engineers to easily understand and gain confidence in their proposed network designs and to iterate these designs more quickly.   The project will be driven by continued interactions with several pilot customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the healthcare needs of the 27 million Americans and 300 million patients globally suffering with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These patients are desperate for a safe treatment that reestablishes glycemic control to augment or replace current management strategies such as metformin and insulin, which only slow the progression of the disease. This proposal provides a unique approach to T2D based on an orally delivered intestinal coating that mimics the beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery. The potential commercial impact of this novel treatment is highly significant as the total estimated cost of diabetes management in the US is upwards of $245 billion, and rising. Overall, an astounding 1 in 5 US health care dollars is used for the care of people with diabetes. Therefore, major insurers are very interested in the reimbursement of alternative approaches for treating T2D, thereby lessening the national cost burden.

    The proposed project supports the further development of an entirely novel treatment for T2D based on new insights from bariatric surgery. The medical community has recently recognized that certain bariatric procedures involving duodenal exclusion confer profound and immediate benefits in glucose tolerance. Sleeve-type medical devices have provided clinical validation for this approach, but such devices are invasive and not currently approved due to safety issues. The investigators propose a non-invasive and safe orally-delivered intestinal coating which is expected to provide the same effect as surgery and implanted sleeves, but requires neither a specialist nor sedation. This proposal describes in-vitro and in-vivo experiments that build on positive results of the Phase I project, and drive the company towards human clinical trials. Specific Aim-1 is to optimize the active lead compound through evaluation of a limited number of rational structural variations. Specific Aim 2 is to demonstrate the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of lead formulations in a chronic diabetic animal model. Consultation with leading endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and material scientists has guided the selection of the materials and methods of this proposal. Completion of the studies outlined in the NSF SBIR Phase II proposal will accelerate clinical translation, bringing this novel treatment closer to patients in need.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II is to reduce the patient harm and financial burden created
    by the intensifying problem of emergency department (ED) crowding.  ED crowding
    is a threat to patient safety for high acuity patients and has been associated
    with avoidable morbidity and mortality across many conditions.  Concurrently,
    EDs are challenged to efficiently manage large volumes of low-acuity patients
    visiting with non-emergency conditions. The proposed electronic health record
    (EHR) integrated technology deploys novel machine learning algorithms that predict
    clinical events at actionable time-points in patients care pathways.  Characterizing
    the ED as a flow system, these decision support tools will concentrate on the
    root causes that exist at ED inflow and hospital outflow. This new foresight is
    expected to enable innovative hospital operational models that expedite patient
    progression (minimize patient waiting), improve patient safety, and directly translate
    to measurable cost-savings and/or revenue generation. The SBIR Phase II project
    should result in higher yield and scalable decision support technology while promoting
    the value of data-enabled science and engineering in healthcare. \n\n \n\nThe
    proposed project objective is to greatly reduce ED crowding by advancing the data-science,
    decision-science, and operations research that underpins our decision support
    technology. This new technology is based upon a novel combination of data normalization,
    feature selection, and supervised machine learning methods to predict clinical
    events that drives clear action to optimize hospital resources.  This includes
    a decision support tool that functions at ED triage (inflow) to predict risk of
    critical events to empower safe separation of service streams for acutely ill
    and non-urgent patients. A complementary tool functions near hospital discharge
    (outflow) to predict expected discharge time enabling hospital-wide prioritization
    of resources required to expedite discharge. This unlocks downstream capacity
    and removes a major ED outflow bottleneck that creates prolonged waiting. The
    proposed technology is innovative by design to be scaled, yet adaptive to hospitals
    individual patient populations, operational objectives, and risk tolerances. The
    technology is expected to further advance learning with providers about how to
    consume new predictive and explanatory information for decision support.  The
    specific Phase II objectives are to continue the development of the technology
    by: (1) integrating feedback into prediction output, (2) developing performance
    monitoring capabilities, and (3) driving systems-based management of patient progression."

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer and Research (STTR) project is a method to control invasive or otherwise unwanted trees and shrubs in an ecologically friendly manner with a biodegradable product. This will reduce the quantity of synthetic herbicides and/or synthetic herbicide adjuvants currently applied to control woody plants. This is especially needed near waterways where vegetation managers must choose between expensive mechanical removal or potential harm to sensitive ecosystems. Homeowners, landscapers, farmers, conservationists, utilities, and other customers will have a new product to control invasive trees and shrubs consistent with a mission to be good stewards of the environment.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to follow initial successful Phase I demonstrations of an enzymatic bio-herbicide or herbicide adjuvant following the principles of termite biomimicry. The objectives of this Phase II project are to identify the mode-of-action, develop high- and medium-throughput bioassays in vitro and in planta, optimize the product formulation, and demonstrate efficacy on various invasive species in the field such as bush honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), bamboo (Phyllostachys aurea), and potentially others.

    The broader impact of this project is to commercialize distance sensing instrumentation
    that advances the development of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) by providing
    improved performance and order-of-magnitudes reduction in sensor size and cost.
    The development of RAS technologies could benefit society by increasing the productivity
    of economic activities in industries that include: mining, oil and gas, transportation,
    manufacturing, construction, agriculture, forestry, and defense. These industries
    are commercially significant and accounted for 24% of US GDP in 2015. Upon development,
    the R-LIDAR system is expected to make a commercial impact in a total addressable
    market for light detection and ranging (LIDAR) distance sensors that is expected
    to reach $739 million/year by 2018. Successful development of the R-LIDAR instrument
    will also pioneer opportunities for resonant scanning instrumentation in related

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from a potential reduction in the capital cost of wind turbines by an astounding 15x. The Company's patented, remarkably simple design also reduces transportation, maintenance, and land costs, and provides greater location and altitude flexibility. It uses the same aerodynamics as today's dominant wind technology, the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but with innovations that build on recent research into airborne wind energy generation. Multiple, 6-meter airfoils (they look like model airplanes) behave exactly like the outer tips of a conventional wind turbine blade, which is where most of the power is generated in a HAWT. The airfoils run along a rail- as if one captured kites and put them on short leashes - and a linear generator makes the power. The proposed research is a continuation of SBIR Phase I research and development that had demonstrated that these principles are scientifically sound. If successful, this Phase II project would drastically reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity, making it competitive with fossil fuels. It would thus be a completely self-sustaining commercially viable entity, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. By out-competing fossil fuels, it would use market forces to encourage renewable energy development, thus reducing energy-related emissions and improving national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project's light weight, low profile, and easy, flexible set-up may also have military and emergency applications that would help secure the national defense.



    The proposed technology captures energy through translational rather than rotational motion in the tips of the airfoils as they run along a rail tethered by bridles. Its major innovation is a patented bridling system that handles downwind forces (aerodynamic tip-over forces), which are the primary cause of the HAWT's mass and cost. Another major innovation is to run airfoils in an oval rather than a circle. This alters the math behind swept area, the key input for generation capacity. Because the oval's swept area is a function of length and height, rather than radius squared, this project can add capacity in many different ways, escaping the tyranny of building ever-bigger and -taller circles. The first objective is to design, test, build, measure, and refine a 100 kilowatt (kW) device. A meaningful-scale second-generation device will demonstrate the project's ability to meet performance, weight, and cost targets, while facilitating decisions about how to build far larger devices, and modeling their costs. The methods and approaches will continue to conquer challenges in five subsystems: structures, aerodynamics, power generation, control, and grid integration. The team, which includes leading experts in both academia and industry, will design subsystem options. It will convene to find the best system-wide design and construct the device, with many refinements along the way.

    scale-up development of eco-friendly, cost-effective novel Electroless Nickel
    Immersion Gold (ENIG) surface finish with high corrosion resistance and robust
    solder joints for better reliability of electronic assemblies. Conventional ENIG
    currently available in the market is prone to black-pad defects (hyper-corrosion
    related failures) associated with de-wetting of solder. ENIG also suffers from
    brittle solder joint failures. Due to these reasons, there are field failures
    and reliability concerns of electronic assemblies - component disconnection which
    lead to overall malfunction of electronic assemblies. Moreover, most ENIG manufacturers/suppliers
    provide cyanide-based gold chemistry which has health and ecological hazards.
    The novel ENIG eliminates black pads- corrosion related issues, achieves robust
    solder joints and provides improved quality and reliability of electronic assembly.
    Also, it uses cyanide-free chemistry for immersion gold process making it eco-friendly.
    This allows manufacturers to consume eco-friendly product while avoiding major
    field failures and resulting consequences. This new technology would be potential
    replacement for existing ENIG (with market value roughly about 2-3 billion USD/year).
    \n\nThe primary focus of the project is to eliminate black-pad related failures
    and lead to robust, high quality and reliable solder joints for electronic assemblies.
    The root cause of black-pad defects has been identified as hyper corrosion activity
    at gold and nickel-phosphorous interface which involves nickel depletion and an
    enrichment of phosphorous in localized areas. During Phase I, interfacial engineering
    approach had been used to successfully eliminate black pads by achieving marked
    improvement in corrosion resistance. This has led to robust solder joints and
    elimination of brittle failures. In Phase II, the focus will be to scale-up development,
    optimize the product/chemistries and carry out further reliability testing. The
    main goal would be the rapid commercialization of novel ENIG into the market.
    This will involve development of the chemistries/process parameters for replenishing
    solution to make it market ready, economical and efficient for customers, further
    chemical testing for quality compliance (shelf life, quality standards, etc.)
    as well as reliability testing. Reliability testing will involve real world scenarios
    and various industry standard based testing including drop and vibration tests
    and solder ball shear and pull tests at extended thermal exposures."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and apply machine learning statistical tools to Internet of Things (IoT) water delivery and water quality sensors. This will enable prediction and preemptive response to water point failures. The resilience of these environmental services is dependent upon credible and continuous indicators of reliability, leveraged by funding agencies to incentivize performance among service providers. In many locations, these service providers are utilities providing access to clean water, safe sanitation, and reliable energy. However, in some rural areas, there remains a significant gap between the intent of service providers and the impacts measured over time. Achieving the SBIR Phase II core objectives will help close the loop on effective and clean water delivery.  IoT sensors and services will address one of the most critical public health gaps by enabling delivery of reliable and safe water.

    IoT solutions for this environment may help address these information asymmetries and enable improved decisions and response. However, given the remote and power constrained environments and the high degree of variability between fixed infrastructure including age, materials, pipe diameters, power quality, rotating equipment vendors (pumps and generators), servicing, and functionality, any IOT solution would have to either be bespoke engineering, or compensate for these site-wise complexities through analytics. Instead, our SBIR II approach is to develop universal, solar powered cellular and satellite IOT hardware for each service type, and addresses site complexities through cloud-based sensor fusion and statistical learning. In this way, we significantly reduce hardware and logistical costs, and provide value to our customers through service delivery analytics. In Phase I, we demonstrated the application of simple sensors and sophisticated machine learning to identify off-nominal service delivery across a cohort of water pumps of various designs. We developed a universal electrical borehole sensor compatible with disparate fixed infrastructure, and we demonstrated solving the problem of heterogeneous customer hardware with a homogeneous sensor platform and adaptive machine learning backend.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will accelerate the adoption of data intensive precision agriculture, increasing yields while decreasing farm inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing. The technology is part of a broad initiative in agriculture addressing the need for large increases in food production by 2050 in response to the projected growth of the world?s population to over 9 Billion people.

    This project will continue development of algorithms for on-the-fly orthorectification, stitching, and normalization of aerial image mosaics and their deployment in an easy-to-use software prototype. The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to disrupt hemodialysis delivery for treating end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a significant health burden in the US. Trends are moving toward patient-managed, in-home treatments. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate adoption of safer home hemodialysis therapy through development of continuously operating, wearable hemodialysis systems enabled by ultrathin and highly permeable silicon nanomembranes. Despite the recognized economic, health and quality-of-life benefits of more frequent hemodialysis treatments, adoption of home hemodialysis using present systems is being limited by doctors? and patients? safety concerns. Simpler and safer hemodialysis therapies will require breakthroughs in both device components and form-factors. The development of a small-scale, highly efficient dialysis system enabled by silicon nanomembranes holds potential for increasing adoption of home dialysis and its related benefits for the 430,000 US ESRD patients.

    Phase I results demonstrated feasibility of methods for large area nanomembrane fabrication, strengthened membranes and identified membrane area requirements for a dialysis system embodiment. Phase II objectives focus on completing larger area membrane fabrication, optimization of membrane filtration properties, integration of membranes into dialyzer modules and testing dialysis efficacy of these dialyzer modules in a nephrectimized sheep model.

    to develop precision-guided delivery of drugs or diagnostic compounds to the site
    of damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is quite common; every year, over
    10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause
    of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available
    that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation
    after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one
    to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job,
    while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to
    use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It
    also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach
    their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology
    to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings
    to the healthcare system may also be obtained. \n\nThe proposed project will develop
    a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to
    acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents
    in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the
    therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company
    described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of
    payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved
    variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring
    optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project
    is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the
    CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries
    to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this
    Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity
    peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted
    drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated
    in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment
    in the form of increased efficacy, reduced side effects, and ease of administration
    should ensue."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.

    To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be focusing on automatic pairing and provisioning of Internet of Things (IoT) for the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry, to help them increase revenue potential by digitizing their apartments. It is estimated that the Smart Home Automation industry will reach $71B by 2018. If installation and setup of IoT devices could be automated and simplified then the MFH industry could roll out Smart Apartments quickly and in large scale. Being able to gather data and insights on buildings could lead to increased revenue from more efficient use of labor and materials and through better management of energy. It also gives them the opportunity to create new revenue streams from software and services targeted at the data output. The MFH industry can also get insights on their entire building portfolio versus a single building and more efficiently manage their entire portfolio. The MFH industry implementing Smart Home Automation technology has huge societal benefits by integrating with smart grids and utility demand response programs. The potential energy savings of 18M Smart Apartments could be hundred thousand gigawatt hours or $7.3B in savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to enable the deployment of a scalable and maintainable infrastructure through the use of mechanisms including automatic pairing, tiered authentication, and network isolation in low cost, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The problem with existing IoT pairing methods is that they are targeted at Single-Family-Home deployments and the number of nodes that needs to be paired are relatively minimal. However, this is not a scalable model when trying to address the needs of the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry. In the multi-family dwelling, the sheer density of nodes creates new problems. The technical challenge that remains for this phase is to ensure that all the devices will easily pair and to differentiate the nodes so that they authenticate and provision to the right apartment in a dense, RF noisy environment. Developing a cost effective, scalable solution for this high-density scenario is a key component to fulfilling the value proposition of mass deployment in the Multi-Family-Home industry. The anticipated result of this project is to solve the issue of pairing large quantities of end nodes and authenticating them appropriately to the correct apartment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the energy consumption from air and gas compression.  In the United States, industrial air compressors consume over 12% of manufacturing electricity consumption, or 399 trillion BTU.  5% of natural gas production in the US is consumed by compression to move the gas to the end-user.  On a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors are estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor driven systems, or 2,267 terawatt hours per year.  At $0.10 per kilowatt hour, this translates into nearly $227 billion of annual electricity costs for compression. Carnot's technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption from compression by 20% or more across multiple compression applications. By reducing the energy consumed for air and gas compression, the technology will reduce the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activity in the US and internationally.



    Isothermal compression has been thought unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression. The Phase I project allowed us to integrate proven design elements from prior prototypes, along with a complete liquid recirculation and heat dissipation system, into a single platform. This project will build upon research performed under the Phase I project to bring our compression technology to commercial readiness. A 2-year research and development plan will be executed to address key systems engineering elements of the technology to achieve commercial ready status.  A combination of lab experiments, thermodynamic modeling, design, engineering, and benchtop prototyping will be used to develop a commercial ready system design that can be applied to a broad range of industrial compression applications.  Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever-evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenge of fouling on membranes used in biopharmaceutical processing. The successful application of this coating would enable increase in the membrane lifetime and product yield of various production streams as less of the valuable compounds remain trapped in the membrane. This can increase production capacity for life-saving medicines, reduce production costs and, in certain cases, enable continuous biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Furthermore, functionalization of membranes currently involve significant quantities of environmentally harmful solvents, which may be leachable during usage of the membrane. This issue is avoided in the current project by utilizing initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process which does not require any solvent. This coating technology can also be extended to other systems including wastewater purification, food & beverage production, industrial separations, and medical devices that rely on a similar functionalization.

    The objective of Phase II will be to demonstrate a commercially viable manufacturing process to produce surface modifications within porous membranes using the iCVD process. Previous work in this subject has focused on top-coats on the top surfaces of reverse osmosis membranes, but the chemistries utilized have never before been demonstrated within interior structures of the membrane filters. During the Phase II work, the performance of the coatings will be optimized by using existing deposition equipment to tune the coating chemistry and process conditions to maximize the flux and throughput by minimizing protein fouling. The other main technical goal of the work will be to translate the current batch process into a continuous roll-to-roll process that is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. The outcome of this study will be a proven coating chemistry that is effective and durable in the membrane application, and an optimized manufacturing process capable of being implemented within current standards of membrane manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the potential dollars saved in healthcare costs to environmental protection. The greatest overall savings cannot be judged only in dollars, but in helping to preserve human lives and end diseases and illnesses caused by problems with water. The product will provide unique opportunity to populations to test their water for safety and health benefits, in locations where good water treatment facilities do not exist. The water testing equipment market is divided into low-end, low-cost on-field test equipment (such as nitrate strip) that gives qualitative information about the analytes, and high-end testing devices used in labs (such as mass spectrometer) providing accurate quantitative information. If successful, the sensor technology will bridge the gap by providing low-cost, sensitive, accurate tools for quantitative measurement of analytes. The portable, low-cost, plug and play sensor product will cater to the needs of the water quality monitoring market. The product will also mobilize ?citizen scientist? to partake in environmental data collection and popularize sustainability education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is expected to lead to the development of a multiplexed, low-cost, portable instrument capable of making real time measurements of nitrate and phosphate in water and soil samples. The sensor system for this instrument will be based on the highly selective nitrate and phosphate reducing working electrodes along with reagents contained in the microfluidics to perform real-time sensing without sample preparation. As the concentrations of phosphate in solution are usually small, and since the inorganic phosphate in a water sample is changing due to biological processes, time is often a critical factor in taking measurements of phosphate. Due to these factors, there is a need for sensitive, inexpensive, and portable instruments in order to monitor the eutrophication process effectively. Currently available instruments for making phosphate measurements in the field do not adequately address these needs. Phase I development showed that disposable electrode with microfluidic integration, and smartphone app controlled sensor is capable of detecting nitrate with high sensitivity and specificity. Phase II proposal is focused on commercialization of the nitrate sensor and development of multiplexed sensor platform to detect multiple ions such as nitrate, and phosphate for larger commercial market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project answers the call that science students go beyond memorizing facts to understand content on a deeper, conceptual level. In chemistry, this goal is particularly difficult to achieve because the underlying concepts describe the behaviors of particles that are not directly observable to students. College instructors are also under added pressure to transform their teaching methods to help ensure student retention and success. In the subject area of organic chemistry, this transformation is even more important, due to the relatively high fail-rate in the course, especially for under-represented minorities and first generation students. The mobile learning tools and data collection platform in this project would help to solve both of these issues with an innovative method for intuitive learning and assessment which helps to make molecules and reactions come alive with game-based mobile applications. The game apps are playable by students of all ages, so the concepts of organic chemistry, as well as other science courses, become familiar and accessible as early as middle school. The broader vision is to open the pipeline for students to progress into STEM careers which have been difficult to reach in the past.

    This project makes the theoretical touchable for organic chemistry students by building mobile game-based learning tools based on mechanisms, a key underlying concept used to teaching the course. This project will produce the Mechanisms suite of game apps, and bring an intuitive, tactile interface to learning chemistry. The research and development of this phase of the project will expand the user interaction model from Phase I to multiple modules of content for students. The data from the mobile learning tools will be synthesized with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive method to ensure the applications provide the appropriate level of challenge to the student learner. Clinical and longitudinal efficacy studies will be part of the research effort as the game modules are developed and released. The data platform will be optimized to integrate with multiple learning management systems and to be readily expandable to subjects beyond organic chemistry. The dashboard of the platform will allow both instructors and students to access the data and inform learning processes to achieve greater comprehension and success in the course. Commercialization will be achieved through direct-to-student downloads, subscriptions of the data platform by institutions, and licensing the technology to courseware providers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is for the development of scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end-user moldable advanced composite materials for use in protective athletic equipment. Currently, protective athletic equipment and accessories must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer, and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines, are intrinsically recyclable in a closed-loop, low-energy, solution-based system. The total U.S. composite materials market is $25 billion, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high temperatures. Polyimine polymers represent a new class of moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase II research project will include scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of one-quarter inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. The Phase II effort will also include a variety of types of material and mechanical testing, both in-house and at certified laboratories, in addition to extensive efforts at proving out manufacturability, as well as pilot production.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase global access to vaccines
    and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases. As an example, Rotavirus
    is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination
    results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create
    cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine
    buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain
    capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only
    have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but
    may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution.
    This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform
    technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This
    technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied
    to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. \n\nThe
    proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global
    need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing
    problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current
    formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions.
    Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage
    or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost
    biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of
    the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization
    of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I
    results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product
    formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves
    all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through
    process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral
    delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process
    that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation
    of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable
    validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization
    and oral film delivery more broadly."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers.  Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market.  Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench.  The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and commercialize an innovative coating which minimizes the accumulation of mineral fouling on industrial heat exchanger surfaces.  Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in industrial processes, such as chemical manufacturing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing, and many more.  Air conditioning for factories and large commercial buildings also represents a significant use of heat exchangers.  Fouling occurs when naturally dissolved minerals in water, often called "hard" water, precipitate out of the water when it contacts a hot surface.  This fouling can be seen in a typical home on the surface of a teakettle or showerhead.  The resulting mineral crystals adhere strongly, and form an insulating layer that materially reduces the thermal efficiency of industrial heat exchangers.  Mineral fouling is estimated to cost U.S. industry $40 Billion per year, and waste $3 Billion of energy, representing upwards of 1% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to wasting energy, this worldwide, never-ending problem increases factory downtime and maintenance costs, causes industry to spend large amounts on chemical treatment of water supplies, and decreases the useful life of heat exchanger systems.  An effective coating will result in substantial environmental benefits including the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the wasted energy, and a reduction of the water treatment chemicals, which eventually enter community wastewater streams.

    The coating material is a low surface energy, self-assembling hydrophobic material which is a composite of a host polymer and a nanoparticle. The low surface energy of the coating impedes the attachment of the minerals to the coated heat transfer surface. Phase I results showed that any fouling accumulation on a coated surface exhibits low adhesion strength, which allows any fouling that does occur to predominantly be dislodged by the force of the water flowing over it - a phenomenon call "self-cleaning."  The coating is very thin - less than 500 nm - which minimizes impedance of heat transfer due to the presence of the coating itself.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing the properties of the coating, including substrate adhesion, surface energy, and toughness to ensure a useful life under industrial conditions.  This will be accomplished by changing the host polymer chemistry to facilitate self-assembly, and also by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle to obtain a covalent bond between the host polymer and nanoparticle.  Work will also be performed to design the application process for industrial scale, and validate lab results with field trials at industrial sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for the realization of a commercial millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring product that can help neurosurgeons in treating patients with hydrocephalus. While the goal of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of said ICP monitor, the technology can also be translated to the development of 'smart dust', opening up the next generation of computing paradigm. This will mark a significant milestone towards massive-scale realization of internet of things, dramatically accelerating the technology adoption and research impact of millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. The technology adoption can be introduced to multiple markets including, but not limited to, medical, industrial, and consumer spaces. This would open up many new commercial opportunities that were previously limited by energy consumption and size, heralding a new era of computing in an unprecedented form factor and lifetime.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for improved treatment of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the brain's ventricle area, causing head enlargement, epilepsy, and death. The only practical treatment for hydrocephalus is surgical implant of medical shunts, which relieves excess CSF to other parts of the body. The biggest problem with existing shunts is that they lack any embedded monitoring feature. Once the shunt is installed, there is no way to measure the internal pressure outside of hospital settings. The proposed monitor enables a 'smart shunt' solution, which continuously records ICP information inside the shunt for many years. This data is read out wirelessly and can be used to prevent shunt failures and improve the treatment of this lifelong disease.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the commercial viability of technology that enables the real time measurement and control of landfill gas extraction systems. It has the potential to improve the economics of the Landfill Gas to Energy (LFG-E) market and reduce the environmental impact of landfills. With industry-wide implementation, annual revenues from existing LFG-E projects could be increased by over $450 million. The additional energy produced would power over 350,000 homes. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), and the EPA estimates that in 2011, emissions from landfills accounted for nearly 17.5% of generation from all manmade sources in the US. The associated reduction in GHG emissions from improved landfill gas collection would be equivalent to the emissions of over 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline or 76 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, because of the improved economics, this Phase II project could encourage the development of new LFG-E projects, further expanding the size and value of this market. According to EPA estimates, currently undeveloped sites could account for an additional 850 MW of power generation, enough to power over 508,000 homes.

    The technical objectives of the project are 1) to reduce the cost of various system components, and 2) to address new product requirements related to third party safety and other certifications that are demanded by the market. The approach to cost reduction is to replace several commercially available off-the-shelf components (specifically, NDIR gas sensors and an electrically-actuated control valve) with custom designed alternatives that can meet product functional requirements at a 30% reduction in cost. In order to achieve the certifications that are demanded by the market it will be necessary to define the specific standards and protection concepts that are applicable, and then re-engineer hardware in accordance with these standards. This will involve a combination of component substitution and system re-design, depending on the specific protection concept(s) and hazardous location classification that are identified. The research will build upon the reliability and product functionality improvements that were a key outcome of the Phase I project, and successful completion of the research goals will enable more widespread adoption of real time control technology in the landfill gas industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to help protect the environment by replacing existing toxic and environmentally-hazardous corrosion inhibitors used as lubricant additives with more eco-friendly alternatives. Release of lubricants (for example from loss during use, improper disposal of waste lubricants, accidental spillage, or off-shore drilling) has the potential to cause damage to the environment. Awareness of the toxic nature of current lubricant additives is a driver to develop new technologies for more environmentally friendly products. This project addresses the development of novel, environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitor lubricant additives. Besides the environmental benefits of the new technology, the lubricant industry  may also benefit by expansion into environmentally sensitive market sectors (for example, marine lubricants used on ships) through the use of safer and less toxic additives. The new products also utilize non-petroleum based raw materials from renewable and sustainable resources, thus reducing dependence on petroleum. Apart from being non-toxic and environmentally friendly, the proposed products are also expected to be more effective inhibitors as compared to the products currently used in the market.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to design and develop environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitors providing high performance while meeting the eco-toxicological requirements of environmentally acceptable lubricants (EAL), including bio-lubricants. The use of corrosion inhibitors in lubricants is essential to protect metal surfaces. Unfortunately, many commercial corrosion inhibitors present issues with aquatic toxicity, persistence in the environment, and/or bioaccumulation that render them unacceptable for use in EAL or bio-lubricants. Awareness of the eco- toxicological problems of current inhibitors and the implementation of new regulations mandating the use of EAL in certain applications (e.g. marine lubricants) has created an urgent need in the market to replace existing products and the opportunity to develop new technologies for corrosion inhibition. This proposal addresses the key steps involved in the product development of corrosion inhibitors for biolubricants; namely (a) molecular design optimization, (b) cost-effective process scale up, (c) preparation of pound scale of lead products in the laboratory set-up; as identified in Phase I, (c) assessment of eco-toxicological properties using industry standard OECD/ASTM test methods and structure activity relationship (SAR) calculations, and (d) product storage stability testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the expedited development of a novel non-surgical medical device and therapeutic treatment for the approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 30 who suffer from urinary incontinence, two thirds of whom, in part due to notable deficiencies of available solutions, elect to live without treatment while their symptoms progressively worsen. Urinary incontinence, although a very private concern, has far-reaching physical, psychological, social, and economic implications. For example, urinary incontinence has been found to reduce health-related quality of life measures on par with depression, incontinence is the number one reason for admittance into nursing homes, and the annual cost to the US healthcare system is estimated at $25 billion. Through design and validation activities this project will demonstrate the functionality of a wearable device that provides discreet, comfortable, easy-to-use therapy for female stress urinary incontinence. The technological understanding gained through this work lays the groundwork for subsequent commercialization of an FDA cleared product that will enhance the lives of tens of millions of American women.

    The proposed project provides a new framework for wearable therapeutics by enabling the patient to treat incontinence via discreet surface electrical stimulation without interruption to daily activity. Current non-surgical care often involves electrical stimulation via intravaginal probe, a treatment most woman are not willing to adopt or maintain. This project builds on successful Phase I feasibility work in which a contiguous array of cutaneous electrodes placed proximate the perineal tissue to deliver sufficient electrical muscle stimulation to promote pelvic floor toning were shown to maintain this efficacy under conditions associated with continuous wear.  The Phase II project goal is to develop an incontinence specific electrical muscle stimulator to function with the electrode array.  The system architecture will enable manipulation of the therapeutic waveform to support future multi-armed clinical studies designed to test the efficacy of various treatment regimens.  The system will also track treatment frequency, duration and intensity to provide information to clinical researchers.  Activity will include design, prototype fabrication, performance testing, human factors assessments, iteration and electrical safety validation.  Refinements to the electrode array are also anticipated.  The project will deliver a device suitable for future evaluation a human clinical studies, FDA clearance and product commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes new ways to inform, educate, advertise or entertain through a technology called projection mapping. This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a commercial implementation of holographic video microscopy, a fast, precise and flexible technology for measuring the properties of individual colloidal particles suspended in fluid media. This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions.  Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

    The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project affects one of the fastest-growing sectors of the US economy. E-commerce sales in 2015 accounted for 7.4% of total U.S. retail and are expected to rapidly rise. The potential for the commercial impact of general each-picking systems is high, as current manual labor methods are pain points for distribution centers; human picking is unpleasant, expensive and inefficient due to high absenteeism, high turnover and human error. The success of the proposed technology will also contribute to American competitiveness in the robotics industry. Of the top 20 distribution system integrators, only three are currently based in the U.S. Robotics is going to be the key driver of progress in this area, where each-picking, our core product capability, is a key component of future automated distribution systems. Beyond warehousing logistics, applications that our technology can benefit include: broad applications of industrial automation and manufacturing; military applications (e.g., IED disposal, where robots can perform tasks that are dangerous for humans to perform); and assistive healthcare (e.g., where robots must be compliant enough to be safe around humans while interacting successfully with unknown environments).

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the development of a state-of-the-art each-picking robotic system and its deployment, initially targeted at the order fulfillment industry. To date, robotic systems have enabled significant progress on transporting inventory on shelves or in totes. However, there has not yet been a deployed system that can perform the task of picking individual items from inventory bins and placing them in boxes for shipment. During Phase I of this project, RightHand Robotics developed a picking system far in advance of the research literature on robotic grasping, picking tens of thousands of items previously unseen objects, with error rates of less than 0.1%. During Phase II, the project will focus on advancing the state of the art in data-driven refinement of grasp planning using machine learning techniques, and will develop methods for box-packing that exploit the company?s advanced compliant grippers. These improvements will result in an average pick-and-place time of 6 seconds or less and an undetected placement failure rate of fewer one in ten thousand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its potential to revolutionize human-machine interfaces, with possible applications in computer-aided design (CAD); military, maintenance, and pilot training interfaces; industrial and construction operator interfaces; robotic and laparoscopic surgery; physical therapy, rehabilitation, and swing training; education; telerobotics; automotive navigation and safety systems; and video games. While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in line with the trend in medicine towards a prevention paradigm, following the premise that preventing problems is generally less costly than treating the problem or managing a future deficit. Excessive noise in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) has been clearly linked to cognitive deficits among the patients of these care areas. However, isolating the infants from any voice contact is also detrimental to language skill development. This project will investigate and develop a system that will provide for a more stable stay in the NICU, mitigate neurologic complications leading to developmental delays, and lessen the occurrence of hearing loss. The American Academy of Pediatrics? guidelines state that neonatal patients should not be exposed to noises greater than 45dBA yet hospitals struggle to achieve this. Deploying such a noise attenuation system with voice pass through capabilities will help hospitals provide the proper environment for their neonatal populations. Hospital administrators and clinical directors have expressed enthusiasm for this solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop an active noise reduction system for use in an NICU incubator, while allowing a parent's voice to pass through essentially unattenuated. To achieve the noise attenuation, the unwanted noise is monitored outside and inside the incubator and a corresponding signal exactly out of phase with the detected noise is used to largely cancel the unwanted noise. The system will employ a multi-channel hybrid system employing both feedback and feedforward elements. While a more complex approach, this has been shown to have performance advantages over simpler solutions. In this phase, the size of the zone of attenuation will be expanded, the algorithm will be adapted to multiple incubators having differing shapes, and a set of fail-safe provisions will be implemented.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to bring a disruptive neutron detector technology to market, filling an urgent demonstrated need for real time, portable and wearable radiation detectors. Successful commercialization of the innovative Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. Market research indicates large scale potential, in the billions of dollars. This market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for portable and wearable neutron detectors are not as well established. The proposed technology will close this gap and is anticipated to have a very broad impact. The Cerenkov detector technology can also be transformative in enabling new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize an innovative neutron detector module based 100% on solid-state technology. The overall objective of the project is to build on the successful Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) detector prototyping in Phase I/IB to develop a small, low cost, modular neutron detector which can be integrated with existing gamma detector technologies to 1) form a comprehensive, scalable, networked solution to the problem of Special Nuclear Material detection; 2) enable inexpensive in-house and third party integration of neutron detection technology into radioisotope identification devices and personal radiation dosimeters; and 3) allow for  further testing and advanced product development relating to directional neutron detector networks, direct fast neutron detectors, and neutron spectroscopy. The research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation and evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics. In particular, in collaboration with a specialty glass manufacturer, the isotopic composition of glass front-end will be optimized for fast neutron detection. The anticipated result is a novel and disruptive neutron detection approach.

The United States spends approximately $9,000 per person per year on healthcare.  Ultrasound medical imaging is a medical imaging technology that could lower costs by providing an alternative to higher-cost imaging techniques.  The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system.  Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  The technology also has commercial potential in the international market, with $5.8B spent annually on medical ultrasound devices worldwide.  Finally, by improving the utility of ultrasound, the technology will lead to improved patient care and may ultimately save lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop deep learning technology for ultrasound imaging in medicine.  Ultrasound imaging has numerous benefits including real-time image acquisition, non-invasive scanning, low-cost devices, and no known side-effects (it is non-ionizing).  However, variability in quality has encumbered its adoption and utility.  As a result, more expensive imaging is typically utilized, often exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Our objective is to develop, improve, and test machine learning techniques, based on deep learning, to improve ultrasound acquisition and interpretation.  We expect this project will create novel technologies that make ultrasound easier to use and improve the quality of ultrasound examinations.  The end result will improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound examinations, will result in cost savings to the healthcare system, will produce improvements in patient care, and will support a sustainable business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the performance of encased atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilevers, reduce their fabrication costs, and optimize their properties for next-generation scanned probe microscopy technologies.  Atomic force microscopy is a workhorse technique for providing nanometer-scale information of materials, but its performance is compromised by viscous damping when operated in fluid.  The encased cantilevers to be developed in this project significantly reduces damping, leading to high force sensitivity and performance which is identical to AFM imaging done in air.  This aids quantitative interpretation of data and simplifies instrument operation. Encased cantilevers are a drop-in replacement, permitting the transformation of existing instruments into cutting-edge tools simply by exchanging the probe.  The impacts of these products will be felt in fields from biology to clean energy to materials science.

    The first technical objective of this research is to create new cantilever geometries that push the performance of our devices to the theoretical limits. The Phase I research resulted in a novel low-cost technique to fabricate encased cantilevers, thanks to the development of specialized semi-automated processing and quality control tools. The next technical objective of Phase II research is to further reduce fabrication costs by improving yields, increasing batch size, and implementing more manufacturing automation. We expect to demonstrate low-cost processing methods in which many high quality probes are fabricated efficiently. The third technical objective is to optimize these devices for next-generation scanned probe technologies including quantitative nanomechanical mapping, high-speed imaging and promising novel techniques such as photo induced force microscopy.  At the end of the project period we will have optimized products specifically targeting these high growth applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to manufacture an advanced hybrid energy harvester that can enable broad deployment of wireless sensor networks. Self-sustainable uninterrupted low-cost power supply with small size is in urgent need for internet of things, portable electric devices, wireless sensor networks, infrastructure health monitoring, active control, and battleground soldier support. Scavenging ambient energy from environment to power these devices can eliminate the cost of replacing batteries, particularly in remote environment. The hybrid energy harvesters developed in this project will significantly improve the power output and response dynamic frequency, therefore provide sufficient power to many such devices. The high power density will also enable more frequent data acquisition and transmission of such sensor networks, and promote more ubiquitous deployment of advanced sensor networks. The automatic manufacturing process will enable their adoption by various customers including internet of things.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will develop manufacturing processes for advanced hybrid energy harvesters. Although piezoelectric energy harvesters have found broad applications, their power density and mechanical-electrical conversion efficiency are still low, with values at microwatts to milliwatt and <10%, respectively since they primarily operate at the d31 mode of the piezoelectric transducer and the mechanical impedance mismatch between the vibration source and the harvesting device. The Phase I project successfully demonstrated that the advanced hybrid energy harvesting device can provide significantly higher power density at > 100 mW and conversion efficiency at > 40% by using the more efficient d33 piezoelectric mode and with reduced stiffness in a curved structure that can efficiently transfer the energy from the vibration source to the active piezoelectric materials. The Phase II project will be focused on developing low-cost innovative automatic manufacturing process to enable their practical applications in commercial and industrial market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will dramatically increase the efficiency of communications networks. Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software.

    to commercialize high-strength thermoplastic composites reinforced with cellulosic
    nanoparticles (CNs) as a replacement for heavier glass&#8208;reinforced composite

    potential of this project is to create sustainable, high&#8208;performance nanocomposites.
    Expected weight savings is between 13 and 20% per component. Corporate Average
    Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations require significant increases in fuel economy
    for vehicles, which has led carmakers to look for innovative ways to shed vehicle
    weight. It has been shown that for every 10% in weight savings, vehicle fuel consumption
    is reduced by 7%. The target application is to replace heavy glass reinforcement
    in polymeric composites with CNCs for car parts, providing lighter weight vehicles
    with increased fuel efficiency.  On&#8208;going research into CN materials has
    resulted in significant reductions in cost (with more reductions expected), making
    CNs an increasingly attractive functional natural nanofiller, the processing of

    Furthermore, the company will improve performance of these materials in order
    to attain performance parity with higher&#8208;loaded glass&#8208;reinforced parts
    and potentially to compete with ultra&#8208;high performance materials such as

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable the availability of a revolutionary manufacturing process for pharmaceuticals. The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year).  A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality.  The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed).  Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs).

    The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing.  The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized.  Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum.  The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis. The integrated process will also feature three unit operations on separation, filtration and drying that were developed during Phase I of this SBIR project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project promises to deliver a convenient, sustainable, cost effective, and environmentally friendly bait for crustacean fishermen, worldwide.  The  patent- pending innovation offers a formulated, synthetic product that mimics scent cues released from traditional fish bait, while offsetting unwarranted ecological impacts of current practices. Specifically, scent cues can be released at variable rates to provide optimal results in addressing fishing methods and preferences in different conditions and regions. Given rising costs of fish due to competition with omega-3 supplements producers, as well as labor and frozen storage costs of obtaining wild bait, and vessel space needed for such bait when fishing, the new bait will save fishermen time, money, and inconvenience. Commercially, cost advantages are likely to generate significant demand in addition to the overall practical advantages. From a societal perspective, a   sustainable,   synthetic product   can   dramatically   reduce "net fishing" for baiting crustacean  traps. Thus, fish could  be   conserved   in the oceanic food chain, and indiscriminate killing of sea turtles, dolphins and other by- catch would be diminished through reduced net fishing practices now employed in the capture of small wild fish traditionally used for crustacean bait.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are: to optimize solubility kinetics of the attractant-releasing matrix; further characterize naturally occurring molecules released by traditional bait fish; and validate product performance to catch indigenous crustacean species in the United States. Field research would focus on concentrations of chemo-attractants required to optimize  manufacturing  formulation  and  direct costs. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity will be the characterization of the chemical basis for cues emitted by piscine, avian and mammalian tissue that most intensely attract crustacean species while developing a range of matrix formulations for optimally releasing such attractants in various fishing conditions. In addition to globally urgent considerations  of  by-catch  and  wild  stock  depletion, the  industry has been struggling with bait sustainability issues. These challenges have intensified with federal and state agencies seeking court orders to regulate catch limits, resulting in reduced supply and higher prices of bait fish. These circumstances frame an ecological and commercial opportunity for this synthetic bait alternative. Reducing the need to capture wild bait fish, as well as delivering cost and logistical advantages to commercial crustacean fisheries are expected to drive rapid market penetration upon completion of product research and development in this Phase II project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures, and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient.

    The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component.  However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new analytical chemistry instrument for rapid quantitation of residual chemical impurities in complex mixtures. The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity.  FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process.  Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release.

    The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals.  It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system.  Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I.  The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required.  FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers.  With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection.  Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology.  The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach.  Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of
    surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and
    reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000
    procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of
    these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into
    longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision
    surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,
    while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as
    the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are
    avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has
    the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image
    guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally
    invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a
    novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during
    surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than
    fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with
    surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical
    inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated
    the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by
    showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This
    Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a
    variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)
    confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an
    ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a
    system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus
    fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these
    objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,
    regulatory clearance and commercialization.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a cost-effective mechanical ventilator
    designed specifically to address the need for pandemic stockpiling and surge capacity
    use. The output of this Phase will be a new ventilator ready for FDA clearance
    and market entry in 2017. US government planners have described a need for many
    thousands of additional ventilators in the event of a pandemic influenza or other
    large-scale medical emergency. Severe influenza often leads to respiratory distress
    which cannot be dealt with in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Given some
    time and a mechanical ventilator, the human body can often clear the infection
    on its own. Without help from the ventilator, patients may die. Manufacturers
    of current ventilators have attempted to reconfigure their existing offerings
    to meet the stockpiling demand. Unfortunately none of these devices are able to
    match the price/performance ratio needed to make stockpiling in large numbers
    economically feasible. Building upon an innovative platform for mechanical ventilation
    developed in Phase I, the project intends to develop a ?gold standard? device
    for pandemic preparedness and emergency use. \n\nThe proposed project is to develop
    a novel and much needed medical device ? a mechanical ventilator suitable for
    pandemic use and emergency stockpiling. If a severe pandemic were to strike the
    United States, the number of patients in need of mechanical ventilation has been
    estimated to be over 700,000. Of these, the most severe cases are often in the
    very old and the very young.  There are currently 62,274 ventilators in use in
    the United States, of which only 23,485 are capable of supporting pediatric patients.
    Research and development activities will provide opportunities for creating new
    intellectual property, new technology, and new clinical methods for managing respiratory
    distress. This research and development project is divided into two Aims. In the
    first, the company will conduct extensive design research to analyze and understand
    the clinical need and all product requirements. We will then design, build, and
    test a series of prototype concepts using sophisticated software modeling, benchtop
    test platforms including mechanical and electronic lung simulation, and real-world
    user feedback. In the second Aim the company will address manufacturing and supply
    chain requirements, integrate design for manufacturing, and build and test a final
    series of near-production prototypes. These late-stage test procedures will include
    clinical performance and accuracy in accordance with regulatory standards, electromagnetic
    interference, and mechanical durability including vibration, noise, and water
    ingress in preparation for FDA regulatory clearance."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the development  of a new class of graphical-media-design system that lies between today's 2D digital paint systems and 3D computer-aided design systems. This technology will allow architects, engineers, artists, and school children to create compelling 3D experiences directly from their drawings without extensive training. Furthermore, it will accelerate the creation of interactive 3D content and significantly reduce the time, cost and expertise currently required to create it. By bridging the gap between traditional drawings and 3D modeling, this project will provide the unique ability to reuse and "reproject" drawn strokes, thus enabling the creation of expressive 3D drawings with minimal effort. The technology developed in this project will help lower the barrier and generate new business opportunities in content creation for electronic publishing and for other creative professionals, such as architects, designers, and ad-agency art directors. Finally, this project includes specific outreach activities, through collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, that will provide unique educational services to the local community, while simultaneously introducing this new technology to the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on making the creation of this new type of graphical media as intuitive and fluid as paper and pencil. This Phase II project will support system improvements - including user-interface improvements - to simplify 3D navigation for the consumers of this media. This will be needed for using this media in digital children's picture books, which have already been identified as early adopters of this technology as well as an important market. Another technical objective will be to develop a hybrid vector-raster representation, which will provide a wider range of artistic expression, while improving rendering performance of large scenes. A third objective is to develop stroke deformation algorithms to support direct manipulation of objects and characters to provide sketch-driven animation capabilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will eliminate remaining barriers to the production of bamboo fibers for use as a reinforcement in polymer composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be an increased usage of sustainable materials, increased revenue for US agriculture, and increased domestic and international sales of a new and innovative product line.  Success in this project will also lead to domestic job creation needed to support the research, manufacturing, and sales of these composites. The processes to be finalized during this Phase II project will support the growth of a nascent based on US-manufactured, environmentally-friendly products. Within three years of launch, it is expected that over $4 million in revenue will be generated by sales of bamboo fiber.  Moreover, increases in bamboo cultivation as a result of these new products will help mitigate adverse environmental impacts and improve public health. This will be done by the inherent sequestration of carbon dioxide in the plant growth cycle, and a reduction in the pollution associated with the use of high-energy glass fiber and plastics processing techniques.

    This Phase II project will address the following research topics:  species variations, manufacturability, additional high value products, additional composite properties, processing and treatment optimization, and commercial scale-up. The team will assess the mechanical and physical implications of variations in feedstock by the use of filament tensile testing. Surface treatments specific to bamboo fibers will be finalized, with the goal of increased fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion, mitigation of water absorption, and compatibility with at least three major resins systems.  These treatments will be evaluated via composite tensile testing, filament testing and water immersion testing.  Manufacturing studies will be performed to verify compatibility with commercial scale manufacturing equipment. The design and manufacture of a small scale, batch plant will address technological and automation challenges.  This plant will provide a bridge to a commercial-scale plant designed to produce 6 million pounds of fiber yearly.  Additional innovative aspects to the project lie in the assessment of a bamboo species compatible with climates in the US, automation of raw bamboo processing, and implementation of a fully optimized multi-step material functionalization process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables an innovative high-productivity approach to manufacturing hard and brittle materials like ceramics, semiconductors, and glass. The objective of this proposal is to build on the successful Phase I feasibility study to demonstrate an efficient and productive method that could manufacture ceramic and semiconductors with excellent part quality. The process, termed Micro-Laser Assisted Machining (micro-LAM), allows a cheaper (~40-60%), faster (by two to five times), and better method of machining and manufacturing hard and brittle materials by combining the preferential heat from a laser source and extreme pressure from a diamond tool. The status quo technology for manufacturing these materials requires extensive machining hours to obtain good part quality, which is not economical. The demand for high-end ceramics and semiconductors is continuously increasing; however, high production costs have forced manufacturers to use other materials with inferior properties.  The goal of this effort is to address this unmet need by commercializing the micro-LAM technology by the end of Phase II. A minimum viable product will be tested at industrial partner sites to obtain firsthand customer feedback, which is key to accelerating the commercialization process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in semiconductor (microelectronics) manufacturing, optics (mirrors and windows), and precision mechanical products (bearing and seals), where the superior properties of advanced semiconductor and engineered ceramic materials are required to achieve performance criteria. This technology will enable entirely new capabilities for production of materials and products currently not viable or achievable due to processing limitations. The micro-LAM technology also has potential applications for emerging technologies, such as wind turbines and plug-in electric vehicles, where high-power and high-temperature operation of advanced devices is required. The current target market size, including optics, semiconductor, advanced ceramics and glass parts manufacturing, is approximately $250 million, with a 15%/year growth rate. Once market acceptance is established in the target market segment, the micro-LAM tooling will be launched into the larger diamond turning machine (DTM) market, with a total size of $2.4 billion.  There are approximately 10,000 DTMs in the United States alone (with ~ 500 new tools introduced per year).

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the continuing development of novel ultrafast, highly selective, high permeability ion-exchange fiber composites (IXFCs) for removing perchlorate from drinking water. The proposed material removes perchlorate 10-100 times faster than the best available technology and employs a low-cost production method compatible with widely available manufacturing equipment. Rapid contaminant removal is made possible by the use of micron-scale mass transfer distances; whereas commonly used beads and granular media are limited to much larger sizes resulting in drawbacks such as difficult containment and enormous pressure drops. However, IXFCs display both high permeability and self-containment due to their permanently intertwined, self-supporting structure. Serionix demonstrated the feasibility of this technology in Phase I and will continue in the Phase II with the following key goals: 1) optimization of ultra-high capacity IXFCs for perchlorate removal; 2) design/build IXFC purification cartridges for evaluation by industrial partners; 3) identify and validate chemistries for complimentary IXFCs that are selective for heavy metals such as lead and mercury; and 4) produce IXFCs at a pilot scale and develop strategy for commercial production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this research is the development and commercialization of a low-cost technology enabling regulatory compliance and improved protection of human health. The first targeted application is perchlorate, which the EPA is set to regulate in drinking water by 2014. This represents only the first commercial opportunity for a platform technology with the ultimate potential to transform the industrial and residential water treatment landscape. Future applications may include ultrahigh efficiency water deionization, softening, and industrial wastewater recycling, personal protective equipment and clothing, and high activity solid acid/base catalysts. Dissemination of data and interpretation will contribute to improved understanding of mass transfer characteristics in fibrous sorbent materials used in both water and air treatment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance the use of engineered cell-based therapeutics in the human gut through the development of technologies for the reliable and reversible colonization of the gut with therapeutic bacterial strains. Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body's natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to allow more consumers to make use of assisted and autonomous driving systems in automobiles. Fully Autonomous Vehicles (AV) will reduce traffic collisions and enable humans to spend less time driving and more time on productive activities. Commercially deploying AVs requires a number of key technologies including sensing, perceptual systems, motion planning, and actuation. Our discussions with leaders and decisionmakers at automotive companies have shown that the development of robust, accurate, and energy-efficient perception systems is a major technical obstacle to creating mass-producible autonomous road vehicles. Of particular interest to automakers is scaling down the computational requirements of perceptual systems while preserving high levels of accuracy and robustness.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use deep learning to create perception systems that are (a) scalable across different computational platforms and (b) scalable across smaller or larger sensor sets. Specifically, the company will develop scalable systems from small compute platforms (used for Highly Automated Driving) to somewhat larger compute platforms (used for Fully Automated Driving). Further, the company will develop perceptual systems that scale from few sensors to many sensors. The goal is to "do more with less," advancing the pareto-optimal frontier of efficiency-accuracy and price-accuracy tradeoffs. The company has already engaged with automotive OEMs and suppliers to develop partnerships and to define metrics for success in this endeavor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation.  Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the leading causes of death and debilitation.  A common means of terminating harmful rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator.  The pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation.  The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias.  Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest.  The team intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients.  Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias.  The phase II project will develop and evaluate a prototype system.  It is anticipated that the project will result in a new implantable medical device that painlessly terminates atrial fibrillation.

    The proposed project centers around further development on the world's smallest 2-way communications satellites and associated ground hardware. Key contributions of this project include system and networking optimization and validation of the technology through end to end demonstrations. The system optimization component will involve the development of system-level models that capture the complex interaction of all elements, including dynamics, constraints, and objectives. The network optimization component will focus on the development of algorithms that enable seamless communications scheduling as the network scales to several thousand devices on the ground.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project spans commercial, scientific and humanitarian applications by extending IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity to remote regions without cell coverage and where satellite data is prohibitively expensive for vital applications including agriculture, energy, shipping, and weather. The satellites and ground hardware being developed in this SBIR Phase II project have been driven towards miniaturization and power reduction to enable a broader range of customers to take advantage of the network by allowing easy integration into their devices and easy-to-install autonomous ground solutions.  The unique launch economics afforded by the miniaturized satellites enable IoT (Internet of Things) sensing and data return at a cost 1/10th to 1/100th that of incumbent satellite data providers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity. 

    The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a safe and sustainable ink for
    the global ink industry. Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced
    annually around the world.  Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum
    or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly
    used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and
    toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules
    capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms
    that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like
    sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered
    in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe,
    renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing
    packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating
    these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact
    of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria
    as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project
    will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments
    for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria
    will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations,
    such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process
    in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and
    reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source
    of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide,
    wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly
    generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria
    strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products
    for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural
    pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms. These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.


    This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide quick and cost-effective access
    to anyone seeking cutting-edge, electromagnetic, simulation tools for research
    and development. This will involve automating the most technically intensive tasks
    required to accurately, reliably, and efficiently design and prototype photonic
    and optoelectronic devices. Current simulation tools require everything to be
    set up by hand which, even for trained experts, is time consuming and error prone.
    Also, the computational design and prototyping of photonic devices involves too
    much trial and error. Our turn-key, on-demand, cloud platform will: (1) reduce
    design time by 50%, (2) lower the unit cost of simulations by an order of magnitude,
    and (3) enable first-time users with no prior training in electromagnetic simulations
    to get up and running with manufacturing-ready designs in a matter of weeks not
    months. Our advanced simulation tools will facilitate enterprises and entrepreneurs
    with bringing products to market in a variety of industries critical to national
    security, health, and education. Easy-to-use and affordable design tools will
    also reduce the need to fabricate and test as many iterations thereby conserving
    environmental resources. This is the next generation of computer-aided design
    (CAD) tools to accelerate photonics innovation and discovery. \n\nThe proposed
    project involves the development of a turn-key, electromagnetic, simulation platform
    which automates complex, multi-step tasks involved in the design and prototyping
    of photonic and optoelectronic devices. Photonics, the science of light, underlies
    critical technologies in telecommunications, networking, photovoltaics, biomedicine,
    photolithography, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Phase II involves
    automating the deployment of finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations
    in four key areas: (1)large-scale shape optimization for devices involving tens
    to hundreds of degrees of freedom, (2) sensitivity analysis to assess the impact
    on device performance of manufacturing errors and predicting manufacturing yields,
    (3) launching simulation jobs using on-demand, scalable, high-performance computing
    (HPC) in the public cloud, and (4) seamlessly importing and exporting planar device
    geometries based on the standard Graphic Database System (GDSII) file format widely
    supported by electronic design automation (EDA) tools and semiconductor foundries.
    This will be made possible by combining advances in machine learning, nonlinear
    optimization, and computational electromagnetics."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of software and monitoring system for the conservation of water resources and the economic sustainability of agricultural crop producers. Agricultural production uses a great deal of water. In California alone, 80% percent of all water usage goes to agriculture. As communities expand and drought conditions develop, the competition for scarce and expensive water resources has become intense. Growers need to minimize costs and water needs by making their irrigation practices more efficient. While new irrigation application technologies have reduced losses from wind drift, leakages and evaporation, large amounts of water are still be wasted as it washes through the soil past crop roots. The technology developed in this project will allow producers to track soil moisture movement through the soil profile and across fields. This will allow producers to develop irrigation strategies based on the unique conditions of their soil types and topography and reduce water waste. It will save producers money and enable them to stay in business and meet new governmental regulations regarding irrigation. Improvements in water management efficiencies and better crop management practices can increase crop production and uniformity, reduce food costs, and help preserve the environment.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses priority challenges currently facing growers, producers, and agricultural scientists in effectively using water for crop (food) production. Soil and crop scientists have been examining the need for acquiring higher resolution moisture and temperature data throughout the root zone and across the landscape. A science-based approach is needed to optimally determine the number, location, and depths of sensors to accurately measure, and then model, soil properties for use in precise, effective and efficient water and crop management. Moreover, for perennial crops such as wine grapes, there also is a need to develop models and predictions relating these environmental conditions and historical data to crop quality and volume as well as long-term tree/vine health. The proposed technology uses novel visual analytics to organize the resulting massive data flows and novel predictive models to allow stakeholders to perform precision management of crops based on soil moisture conditions and other field conditions that have not been possible to date.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to establish a broadly applicable, breakthrough biocatalytic technology to produce an important class of compounds called chiral cyclopropanes.  Cyclopropanes are key intermediates that are used in the synthesis of drugs, crop protection agents, and high-value electronic chemicals. Products accessible using this technology have markets totaling more than $10 billion annually. If successful, the technology under development will create safer, cleaner, more sustainable routes to important chemical products that will lower cost by reducing the number of production steps, lowering the required capital investment, significantly decreasing waste. Replacing existing chemical routes with the more efficient and sustainable enzyme-catalyzed steps will also improve the purity of many advanced pharmaceutical intermediates used in the manufacture of drugs and crop protection chemicals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to build on the results from Phase 1 in which a highly efficient biocatalytic process for the manufacture of the drug ticagrelor was developed using a novel, engineered enzyme. We will create an expanded set of cyclopropanation biocatalysts with the capability to act on a wider range of starting materials, thereby broadening the scope and utility of this new enzymatic reaction. We will complete the development and commercialization of the process for production of the key intermediate for ticagrelor and initiate work to develop novel biocatalysts to produce ley intermediates for anti-viral drugs. We will also develop and commercialize a set of enzymes that can be used by drug discovery chemists to establish efficient routes for next-generation drugs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from greatly improving mobile app user experience, boosting developer productivity, and speeding up mobile innovations by automating the mundane and simplifying the complex in Android app testing.  Apps are now everywhere.  They innovate almost every industry.  By making it easy to build high-quality apps, users enjoy better experience and developers enjoy better productivity, benefiting every industry and person that use apps.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to modernize the software development process by combining both program analysis research breakthroughs and big data technologies. Toward this vision, this project aims to build a unique product with innovative technologies to help developers automatically test Android apps. The product continuously tests apps across code changes to detect issues such as performance regressions, crashes, and memory leaks, as soon as problematic code is introduced. In contrast, existing tools often alert developers too late, after real users have been affected and many code changes have been merged, making it both stressful and difficult to find the problematic code. The proposed product gives actionable diagnosis by pinpointing what problematic code developers need to fix and explaining the why and how of the fix. It is thus much more intelligent and easy to use than existing tools.

    This project uses novel methods to improve Natural Language Processing and Machine

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing state-of-the-art tools allowing anyone to build and deploy domain specific commercial intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) solutions. These tools allow others to understand how IVAs should be architected and integrate IVA technology into their offerings. IVAs have shown promise in numerous commercial domains including financial services, healthcare, education, law enforcement, and retail, to name a few, reducing the barrier to knowledge access within domains by providing a medium for people to converse naturally with sophisticated computer and information systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the significant technological challenges involved when scaling the domains and capabilities of an Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA). This project will innovate in designing scalable artificial intelligence models capable of learning and identifying hundreds or thousands of learned concepts, and designing the accompanying system architecture to support the growing compute demand of sophisticated algorithms. Specifically, the project aims at achieving: (1) Scalable Intelligence: the ability to handle hundreds or thousands of competencies and extractable semantic concepts, allowing users to interact with the system with unbounded, unconstrained language; (2) Customizable Intelligence: the ability to allow customers to (semi-) automatically train and (re)train and customize the intelligence on demand (adding new competencies, identifying new slot-value pairs, modify responses); (3) Conversational Complexity: support multi-turn conversations, where the context from prior utterances is used to refine and understand what the end-user is trying to accomplish; and (4) Scalable System Infrastructure: enhance open source IVA software infrastructure to seamlessly scale up and down the computational resources allocated for each intelligence engine based on load.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from the development and commercialization of a networked-based, easy-to-use, fast and accurate tool that will allow architects, consultants, manufacturers of green building products to quickly compare, manipulate and optimize lighting strategies, perform whole-building annual glare analysis and access recommended manufactured products as solutions, to help make informed decisions for integrated design. Daylighting is a crucial piece of the green building puzzle. With the appropriate tools, daylighting is arguably one of the most cost-effective methods of achieving high performance buildings (and happier, healthier occupants) throughout the design process. World-wide green building is expected to double every three years. The world's green building market is a trillion-dollar industry, moreover, the green building materials market is expected to reach $234 billion by 2019. By 2018, green construction will directly contribute 1.1 million jobs and $75.6 billion in wages by 2018 in the United States. Between 2015 and 2018, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings in the United States are estimated to have $1.2 billion in energy savings. Green buildings use fewer energy and water resources; save money for families, businesses and taxpayers; reduce carbon emissions; and prioritize environmental and human health.


    This projects proposes to create robust software for measuring, analyzing, and for recommending solutions to glare in buildings. A novel dynamic tree parallelization architecture is proposed to manage complex, dynamic, and massive amounts of lighting calculations. This will include building the first commercial grade 3 and 5 phase lighting analysis engine. It will also produce a new generation artifact for creating and manipulating data for glare analysis. It will conclude with a validation study.

    use, adding another avenue for science learning, and a sustainable business model
    for the Company through school and commercial sales.  The technology can also
    support independent learning in underperforming schools. The development of the
    scientist avatar artificial intelligence technology will have wide application
    for many other educational and training requirements.  \n\nThe innovation is a
    unique platform for independent learning about the sweeping science saga of atoms
    during the history of the Universe and Earth, and the connection of each student
    to that history through the trillions of atoms they inherited from prior beings
    like Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex.  The platform combines video games, a
    complementary fictional story book (based on the science) that acts as game introduction
    and player guide, and in-game avatars (like Albert Einstein and Henrietta Leavitt)
    that can provide verbal answers to students' spoken questions.  The artificial
    intelligence backing the scientist avatars includes learning manager software
    that guides student learning and provides assessments of progress in achieving
    pre-established learning goals. Four players cooperate in time travel adventures,
    exploring the human body, the Earth, and the Universe to find out what STARDUST
    is (atoms), how and when it was created (in the Big Bang and supernovae), how
    it got into Einstein, and from him to others (e.g., the carbon cycle). Excellent
    test results for the Phase I prototype game suggests a successful start at creating
    good player engagement. The project will continue to combine learning and engagement
    in 10 additional episodes with new scientist avatars including female and minority
    scientists."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from addressing the
    important hand gesture based input challenges of VR/AR (expected to grow to $150B by
    2020), Robotics and IoT ($135B by 2019 and $1.7T by 2020 respectively). This technology,
    if successful in mitigating the high technical risks, represents a huge leap in the state of the
    art in 3D hand models for gesture recognition and has the potential to be the industry
    standard for AR, VR, Robotics and IoT applications with broad societal impact in education,
    medical and healthcare. Its broader impact is further amplified by the potential in serving the
    needs of the disabled community in improving their quality of life by being better able to
    communicate, learn and adapt to their interaction needs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to significantly
    advance current 3D hand gesture recognition technology by developing a dynamic hand
    tracking model for gesture intent recognition. It is robust against occlusion and tolerant to
    variations in camera orientation and position. This research will result in a transformative
    leap above the current state of academic and commercial hand models and overcome key
    technical hurdles that have so far proven difficult to overcome. It solves the following key
    challenges and involves very high technical risks: 1) robust hand tracking while holding
    objects and 2) robust tangible interactions using objects without using any fiducial markers
    2) low profile hand wearable for touch interaction detection. This Phase 2 project will
    achieve these objectives by 1) data acquisition and hand-object pose estimation, 2)
    understanding user intents with enhanced tangible interactions, and 3) system validation
    and user testing.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be to demonstrate the potential
    of the technology to dramatically reduce the cost and risk currently associated
    with production of bio-based products, enabling ultra-low cost product development.
    The field of metabolic engineering historically has been limited in predicting
    the behavior of complex biological systems in vivo from simplified models and
    basic in vitro biochemical principles. In many cases, it has proven much more
    difficult than expected to integrate a well characterized production pathway into
    a living host and balance the complex requirements of both biomass growth and
    production. The technology under development is a first of its kind, truly scalable,
    high-throughput metabolic engineering platform enabling the rapid development
    of microbial production strains. This significant reduction in development cost
    enables the possibility to produce numerous specialty products that would otherwise
    not have acceptable internal return on development capital. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project will develop a high throughput metabolic engineering platform that
    enables the rapid development of microbial production strains. The platform, which
    bridges a gap between current in vivo and in vitro bio-production approaches,
    relies on the dynamic minimization of the active metabolic network in the context
    of a standardized two-stage bioprocess. Metabolic networks are highly interconnected
    wherein each metabolite and/or enzyme can interact with endless others. This combinatorial
    complexity results in a huge potential design space, which is intractable to the
    kinds of systematic experimentation required for the development of standardized
    design principles. The global challenges in addressing such a large biological
    design space have persisted, despite the dramatic advances in, and decreased costs
    of, reading and writing DNA, high-throughput DNA assembly, and microbial strain
    construction approaches. Dynamic metabolic network minimization not only results
    in a design space with greatly reduced complexity, but also provides strains that
    are robust to environmental conditions. Robustness leads to predictable scalability
    from high-throughput small-scale screens or \"microfermentations\" to fully instrumented
    bioreactors. This project will extend the validation of predictable strain performance
    from high-throughput microfermentation to pilot scale fermentation."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a platform technology for point of care (POC) detection of disease biomarkers present in low concentrations in bodily fluids. This technology can greatly impact the current standard medical workflow by reducing the time-to-results from days or weeks to 15 minutes, allowing for disease screenings during routine doctors visits supporting early diagnosis and improved treatment monitoring. It will promote preventative care, and therefore lead to improved treatment outcomes, patient satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs. This technology will be incorporated into a portable, low-powered device that can be operated in-the-field, in low-resource settings in the US and internationally, supporting better healthcare monitoring that is often absent in under-served segments of society. The first target application is the detection of liver cancer, a disease that, when diagnosed late, has an extremely high mortality rate and cost of treatment. The proposed system may aid in the screening and early diagnosis of liver cancer. Furthermore, due to the technology?s inherent potential for multiplexing, it may be possible to simultaneous detect multiple biomarkers for chronic liver disease (Hep B, C, and cirrhosis), increasing its applicability to a global patient pool of over 500 million patients.

    Medicine is increasingly focused on personalized and preventative care and hence there is an increasing demand for diagnostic tools that can facilitate rapid screening, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. Most current POC tests on the market are lateral flow based and do not target high sensitivity applications like cancer biomarkers, which require quantitative results and are present in low concentrations in blood. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop a standalone diagnostic system consisting of a portable reader and disposable cartridges to rapidly diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the quantitative detection of AFP. During year 1, a 20-sensor very-high frequency (VHF) biochip will be designed and fabricated, simultaneously the whole blood processing component of the cartridge will be developed and integrated to form an all-inclusive cartridge. A distributed standalone electronic system will also designed and tested in year 1. Year 2 will involve the integration of the reader components to form a standalone system, additionally the all-inclusive cartridge will modified to interface with the reader allowing for plug and play operation. The performance of the integrated system will be evaluated via detection of HCC biomarkers in registry samples and comparison to the current standard of care.

    STEM fields are widely regarded as vital to a nation's economy, but a disconnect
    exists between the STEM knowledge and skills that students acquire in schools
    and those that they need to succeed in an increasingly global, technology-dependent

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable significant improvement in the shelf-life of unstable natural food ingredients and enable replacing artificial with natural colors in a large portfolio of products of interest to the food and beverage industries. Consumer demand for all-natural ingredients in food has increased multifold, primarily due to health concerns. Despite the strong consumer demand, delivery and stability of natural food colors pose a great challenge for the food and beverage industry. This challenge results due to an inherent chemical instability of natural ingredients and due to their accelerated degradation during food processing and storage. But the current solutions are not cost-effective and require the use of synthetic additives and preservatives, which are not desired by the consumers. This project is aimed at providing an array of low-cost, stable natural ingredients that will improve the overall stability of the finished products both during food processing and storage. This will also address the unmet societal needs for healthy food ingredients and improving sustainability of food products.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop bio-based encapsulation solutions to improve natural food color and phytochemical stability in food and beverage products. Current solutions are sub-optimal providing limited pH (color), heat or oxidative stability and short expiration dates on food and beverage products. To address this unmet need, this project aims to develop encapsulation of natural colors and bioactives that will enhance the overall stability of a finished food product. This will be achieved by working on the primary objectives of this project: Selection and screening of the carriers and natural ingredients to be encapsulated, physico-chemical stability testing of the encapsulated ingredients, scale-up methodologies, stability testing in a finished food/beverage product, consumer evaluation and customer validation of the formulations. As a result of the proposed approach, solutions will be provided that will allow the food and beverage industry to replace artificial with natural colorants as well as significantly extend shelf-life of their desired food products. This will also benefit the consumer who is seeking natural health-promoting ingredients in what he/she consumes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through providing a wearable alcohol monitoring device to the general population which will lead to a better awareness about alcohol consumption, and ultimately enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce burden of illness and disability. Incautious alcohol use causes health and social problems that either manifest over time due to sustained drinking (e.g., heart disease, cancer, liver disease, diabetes, etc.), or are short term effects of acute intoxication and/or impaired decision-making (e.g., motor vehicle crashes, violence, etc.). Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths per year in the United States from 2006-2010 and in 2006 alone cost the economy approximately $224 billion. In light of the above social impact, the proposed graphene based wearable alcohol monitoring device addresses the urgent need to implement health approaches to reduce the loss of life and the huge economic costs that result from excessive drinking. In fact, the growing need for personalized health-care is highlighted by the estimated market size of $19 billion for wearable biosensors by 2018, pointing towards the potential commercial opportunity for self-monitoring alcohol sensors as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the unmet need for a small, light, unobtrusive, convenient-to-use alcohol sensor for real-time self-monitoring of alcohol consumption. Excessive alcohol consumption is a health risk behavior and the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Most strategies to improve safe drinking rely on obtaining accurate and timely information about alcohol consumption; these include self-report of number and timing of drinks, breathalyzers, blood analysis by lab, and wearable devices. Wearable alcohol monitors have clear advantages in terms of accuracy and feasibility compared to other methods for self-monitoring. However, current wearable devices for alcohol monitoring are bulky, inconvenient to use, obtrusive, and do not provide consistent, real-time data on the level of intoxication. In this Phase II SBIR project, a stand-alone graphene nanoelectronic transdermal alcohol sensor integrated with calibration electronics and Bluetooth transceiver will be developed, tested and benchmarked on a large group of recruited adult volunteers. Good correlation between the graphene sensor and a legal grade breathalyzer in large-scale human tests will confirm the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed sensors, which can then be shipped to early adopters, pitched to investors, and ultimately introduced for sales.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to empower farmers to capture a greater share of revenue from the marketing of their crops.  Agriculture is a significant engine to the U.S. economy, and farming itself is vital to creating economically vibrant rural areas.  Farmers are often at a disadvantage when it comes to capturing good prices from their crops because there are significant information asymmetries in the marketing supply chain.  We have developed a combination of hardware and analytics that greatly improves crop forecasts at dramatically more accessible prices, which allows farmers and their trusted buyers to make more informed marketing decisions.  Whereas improved agronomy could raise yields by 5-10%, improved marketing could raise revenue >25%, especially for high value crops.  In addition to the narrow application of sensing hardware and analytics for forecasting, the data collected by our platform can also be used by growers to make decisions that improve operational performance of complex agribusinesses and improve the agronomy of the farm. These tools make it easier to compare performance of crops to improve yields and reduce resource costs.  Together this technology continues to raise productivity and profitability per farmer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates a completely novel plant and weather sensing platform with analytics that synthesizes data into actionable forms that can drive agribusiness decisions.  We have bundled a suite of capabilities into a single hardware unit that includes sensing, communications, GPS, mounting, and solar power, which dramatically reduces the cost and increases the simplicity of collecting agricultural data.  These data are uniquely designed to monitor crop performance and its sensitivity to weather and management.   Data synthesis is a critical pain point in transforming raw numbers into insights for growers to act upon. By creating an integrated hardware platform, the data is poised to provide useful advice that allow a farmer to act on emerging situations, anticipate upcoming events, and even predict the future.  Our research objective here will be to generate probabilistic forecasts that use the unique data from our hardware to estimate key crop growth parameters and project forward for an operational yield forecast.  This coupling between highly informative quantitative in-field data and sophisticated parameter estimation and forecast techniques could dramatically improve marketing decisions and help farmers capture better prices for their products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in improving the performance of the computational back-end of a display system that delivers personalized information in public spaces. Currently, the primary method for an individual to receive customized information in public spaces is through personal devices. The heavy use of personal devices in public often leads to heads-down, isolating, and even hazardous situations. The delivery of personalized information through infrastructure can significantly improve these issues. However, the bandwidth requirements in doing so have been prohibitively high using standard computational architectures. This project aims to improve the performance of such a system, allowing practical applications that will broadly enhance safety, accessibility, transportation, and other areas.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on creating a scalable computational pipeline and architecture that will allow a display system to direct personalized visual information in real-time to large numbers of people. Technically, this involves computing, transmitting, and displaying image data for large crowds in parallel. The architecture takes advantage of the inherent redundancies in this application to provide a cost-effective solution. The goal of the project is to create a computational back-end capable of driving, in real-time, a system equivalent to thousands of displays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address a strong commercial and scientific need for operational synthesis of spatially consistent and temporally relevant historical and current high resolution satellite imagery for analytical purposes. The technology will contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge especially in the geospatial arena and to market spillovers. By dramatically simplifying access to accurate imagery for any time and place, this technology will provide companies, researchers, educators, students, and regular citizens with a valuable tool for visualizing and exploring our changing planet and will contribute to increasing public engagement with science and technology. Further, the analytical capabilities offered by the imagery have great potential in scientific applications thus contributing to partnerships between academia and industry and improving datasets for research and education. Finally, this technology will be valuable in operational settings at the large providers of commercial satellite imagery, to individual users, and enable a wide variety of new visualization, analysis, and data mining applications. The examples of commercial applications for the technology are virtual earth, insurance and reinsurance, agriculture, emergency, change detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will operationally synthesize accurate regional-to-global, high spatial / high temporal satellite imagery of the Earth. The technology will utilize advanced data fusion algorithms to combine various sources of imagery while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of the data sources. The complexity of accessing, processing, and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial / high temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The technology will overcome these limitations by implementing algorithms that are robust, automated, scalable, deliver accurate data, and are usable in operational settings. They will provide spatially consistent and temporally relevant imagery which will empower businesses with regional and global outreach to make better decisions with better data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition soybeans that have high levels of protein for use in aquafeed. Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.

    This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a software platform for the engineering of living systems. Specifically, it will complete a software ecosystem that builds upon a core set of computational tools for the specification, design, build, test, analyze, and archive activities in synthetic biology and couple them with a rich set of interfaces to expert services (e.g., DNA synthesis, data analysis). The proposed work involves the completion of state-of-the-art design approaches and algorithms and couples it with the ability to create customized, modular workflows based on genetic circuit design, metabolic pathway modification, and genome engineering. The proposed work advances computational approaches in synthetic biology as well as innovating in the way that software services are monetized with biotechnology companies. The anticipated result of this work is a commercial software package and associated service agreements that can be deployed to both large and small biotechnology companies fundamentally changing the way that synthetic biology designs are conceived, designed, and physically created.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a software platform where the goal is to combine bio-design automation (BDA) software with explicitly integrated access to expert services in a workflow-driven software ecosystem.  The creation of novel living systems using biotechnology to engineer new medicines, materials, and fuels is frequently an ad-hoc process involving long iteration cycles, wasted resources, and sub-optimal designs. The software will allow for the automated specification, design, fabrication, test, and archival of complete plans for the engineering of novel engineered biological systems. This software includes mechanisms for specifying biological "rules," DNA assembly strategies, and automated generation of robotic instructions.  In particular, this effort will focus on the creation of genetic circuits, engineered metabolic pathways, and genome engineering.  The approach provides tools representing state-of-the-art advances in BDA while introducing novel methods of interacting with a large, diverse set of expert service providers. Further, the approach will empower novice experimentalists while enabling expert computational engineers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an informatics-based software platform that will help pharmaceutical companies create more new, effective, and safe drugs earlier in the R&D pipeline. This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients while reducing healthcare costs by ensuring proper post-surgical drainage. In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications.

    The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use. In the third Aim, the device?s supplemental ability to monitor lung healing status in patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be refined and tested on the benchtop and in an in vivo animal study.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling more efficient Annual Wind Energy Production (AEP) while reducing the cost of energy (COE). This will make wind energy more attractive economically, improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and indirectly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2% AEP increase is generally considered attractive. Two turbines (5kW and 50kW) tested during Phase I have shown an increase in AEP between 2% to 8% while reducing the COE by 1% to 6%. About 150,000 turbines worldwide can be potentially be retrofitted with this technology.

    This project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines and the cost of wind energy. It is based on a deeper understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics from a more 3-dimensional point of view; most wind turbine designs are based on 2- dimensional theories. The key technical challenge in bringing this technology to market is to demonstrate the increase in AEP of utility scale turbines retrofitted with our deflector technology in realistic field conditions while reducing the COE. This will be addressed by performing testing at a few customer wind farms and NREL testing centers. The R&D plan consists of designing, manufacturing, and installing deflectors on a few utility size turbines (30-100 meters diameter rotors). The tests will include power performance comparison between baseline and retrofitted turbines according to international standards.

    Innovation Research Phase II project is to offer a low-cost novel filter to purify
    water with higher effectiveness and superior performance than currently available
    technologies such as carbon filters. The global water scarcity, including some
    parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient
    technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently,
    there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated
    compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are
    being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by
    PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water,
    and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies.
    To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable
    filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs.
    The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater
    and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water
    reuse. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype
    water filter,  test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with
    a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of
    the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis
    method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration
    process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology;
    and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the
    filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the
    regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed
    from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will
    also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine
    its cost-effectiveness."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The In-Situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost 3D-TLC and QLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computation directly on the data with the addition of specialized In-Situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from it having far-reaching societal, commercial, and technological impact. (1) Initial research by the Principal Investigator on analyzing the energy drain of AngryBirds has demonstrated the severe energy inefficiency of popular mobile apps in today's app market. The importance of this work is heightened by smartphones being an important enabler of Internet access for disadvantaged people in both developed and developing countries, and hence being an important tool in overcoming the "digital divide". (2) Commercially, the project will foster a paradigm shift in the mobile app industry ($101B industry in 2020) from the current feature-centric to energy-aware app design. Such a paradigm shift will have a significant, long lasting impact on the app industry. Energy-efficient apps lead to longer battery life, which in turn leads to longer user engagement time, which ultimately translates into millions of dollars of increased mobile revenue as all major businesses are shifting towards mobile. Hence this SBIR project will lead to a marketable product. (3) Technically, the proposed work will extend the performance profiling technology that is foundational to the software industry into the energy dimension, which is critical to the mobile software industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the industry's first app energy management (AEM) solution to help app developers reduce app battery drain, and extend the battery life of billions of smartphones. The research objectives are (1) to develop advanced energy debugging techniques that can automatically identify energy drain opportunities from legitimate energy hotspots; and (2) to develop an SDK-based app energy monitoring system for monitoring app energy drain when running on consumer phones in the open market. These objectives pose significant technical challenges. While similar challenges on performance metrics (such as running time) have been well studied for traditional software, in particular in high-performance computing, in this project the company is expanding them to the energy dimension for the mobile app industry, which has not been attempted before. The company will develop novel machine-learning based solutions to learn, classify, and auto-detect energy optimization opportunities. As a result it expects to develop the first set of solutions to these fundamental challenges in optimizing the energy drain of millions of mobile apps in the app market.

    support the technological refinement and concomitant commercialization of the
    first accurate and portable instrument that can perform in the field nondestructive
    test for hardness, strength and ductility of existing infrastructure. The material
    properties measured include yield strength, work hardening exponent and ultimate
    tensile strength of metals, specifically steel. The on-shore oil and gas pipeline
    transmission industry has pressing needs for non-destructive tests because of
    the aging infrastructure, national need for energy, and recent explosions and
    leaks that have cost lives and billions in remediation. Although transmission
    pipelines have low failure rate per mile of assets, pipeline operators are asked
    to proactively enhance pipeline integrity where they do not have all the necessary
    strength data.  Therefore, there is an immediate need to verify strength during
    the 80,000 excavations done each year so that the life of these costly assets
    can be extended by identifying and remediating the few sections that are vulnerable
    within the extended network of 300,000 miles of pipelines. Pipe cut-outs and hydrostatic
    pressure tests are alternatives to nondestructive testing, but both damage the
    asset and require expensive and complex service interruption. \n\nThe overall
    technical objective of the Phase II work is to perform the necessary research
    and development to enable the development of engineering specifications, system
    integration, and validation of the instrument to successfully perform valuable
    nondestructive testing to provide precise and accurate material property data.
    The research and development program includes three milestones, each enabling
    the implementation of the research into design and manufacturing of beta test
    units.  Milestone 1 is to enable full instrument functionality under adverse field
    environments such as vibration, moisture, and extreme temperatures. Milestone
    2 is to perform the necessary work for designing ruggedized field units. Completion
    of this milestone will enhance the capability for initial field testing services.
    \ Milestone 3 is to develop the knowledge to fully and reliably integrate the
    system, validate the sub-systems, and package it for manufacturing. The overall
    goal is to enable the company to have the necessary knowledge and experience to
    enter the instrument market with a leasing program for use in pipeline inspections."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at improving healthcare patient outcomes,
    potentially saving lives, and decreasing healthcare costs. The Drug Quality and
    Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile injectable
    compounded medications that have closed many third party suppliers, thus creating
    shortages and higher prices.  In response, the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists
    expects 40% of the US market, 2000 hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds.
    \ Hospitals that insource hope to decrease their costs and improve patient safety
    with higher quality product.  Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple
    information systems and use paper records cobbling together how a compound is
    made and to whom it has been administered.  When an ingredient recall occurs,
    hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours identifying the problem source and affected
    patients. To prevent further patient risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase
    I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management
    that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients.
    \ Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications
    and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and
    potentially saving lives.  \n\n\nThe proposed project is a novel medication barcoded
    label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide
    track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives
    include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive
    Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation
    to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.
    \ Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with
    minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels
    could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However,
    existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.
    \ The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded
    label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually
    to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental
    conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication
    labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled
    or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted
    data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project
    will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized
    data from the EHR"

    proposed system will enhance the ability of the 1.3 million people currently living
    in the United States with a lower limb amputation to walk in unconstrained environments.
    \ The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6:
    Human Assistive Technologies area.  QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery
    life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments
    by using battery energy to tune its physical system properties, ankle equilibrium
    angle and torsional stiffness.  The device provides a unique set of features that
    do not currently exist in the market, strengthening its value proposition.  The
    amputee population is growing; 2,000 new lower limb amputation are performed each
    week.  Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal
    impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb
    amputees.  This will also lead to more community and family involvement.  Additionally,
    because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able
    to study amputee compensation preferences.  A better understanding of the kinematic
    and kinetic preferences could lead to improvements in the design of purely passive
    ankle prostheses.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2
    project addresses the needs of lower limb amputees. Lower limb amputees suffer
    from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased
    reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with
    increased risk of falling.  Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground
    walking at one speed.  QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve
    a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint,
    adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range
    of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground
    and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally
    and smoothly.  In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will
    be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the
    device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing
    on improved amputee gait performance in unconstrained environments, and being
    simple to fit and adjust, reliable and affordable."

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop an easy to use real-time formative assessment tool for educators that will be uniquely aligned to each student and deployed via a virtual reality learning game that uses venomous marine snails as a conduit for exploring scientific issues in nature. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals.  Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

    The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning. This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online and virtual reality games which continuously engage users in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery using novel formative assessments customized to each player. The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base. The anticipated results from exposing teachers and students to this project will be increased competencies in STEM, which will transform players into lifelong learners and enhance engagement in STEM fields and careers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or "programs" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the use of a new carbon-based water treatment process to condition and soften hard water sources. Specifically, this treatment process uses functionalized porous carbon sheets and small applied electrical voltages (<1.2 V) to target (adsorb and desorb) salt molecules from hard water streams. In addition, this process is reversible, resulting in a carbon-based filter that can soften water streams without significant maintenance or upkeep and providing a water softening solution that does not add to the "throw-away" culture that is common to many water treatment devices. Importantly, no salt or chemical additives are needed for this softening technique, further limiting its environmental impact in comparison to conventional salt-based softeners, and the energy required for this separation may best the most efficient techniques in use today.

    The proposed process is called inverted capacitive deionization (i-CDI). In i-CDI, salt molecules are naturally attracted to the carbon electrode surfaces due to the creation of electrodes possessing significant surface charge in aqueous environments. Electrodes are then regenerated using a small voltage, matched to the surface chemistry of the functionalized carbon electrodes, and salt is concentrated into a discharge stream. Through this Phase II project, the i-CDI process will be demonstrated for water softening applications in both food & beverage and industrial environments. Currently, water softening in these industries is carried out through chemical treatments, ion exchange, or selective membranes. In this project, surface charged carbon electrodes will be used in "flow-through" cell modules to demonstrate preferential removal of calcium, magnesium, carbonate, and other hardness-causing ions to soften multiple hard water sources. Comparisons will be drawn between this new i-CDI technology and incumbent water treatment techniques to outline benefits towards equipment downtime, energy costs, and effectiveness of the separation. Liquid sampling and lifetime studies will be conducted to further prove the benefits of this membrane-free, salt-free system.

    Research Phase II project provides a technology platform to convert non-food biomass,
    such as wood and corn stalks, into biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts. Biomass
    utilization is a solution to increase global sustainability and decrease petroleum-based
    greenhouse gas emissions. This project will use wood biomass to simultaneously
    co-produce three high-end products, dissolving pulp, furfural, and technical lignin,
    of which the dissolving pulp and furfural are the focus of this project. Current
    methods of producing these products only use one of the three primary biomass
    components. By co-producing two products, revenues increase and unit production
    costs decrease as production costs are spread over a larger product volume. The
    use of this solvent obtained from the biomass is a unique approach in the biomass
    conversion industry and offers an alternative to conventional enzyme or microbial
    processing. Benefits include restoring furfural production in the United States,
    decreasing dissolving pulp production costs, and increasing the commercial value
    of renewable biomass that currently has low or no value. This sustainable and
    environmentally friendly technology will increase global sustainability and revitalize
    rural economies by stimulating investment and creating jobs. \n\nThe objectives
    of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate and advance to pilot scale
    our technology to simultaneously co-produce dissolving pulp and furfural from
    biomass using gamma valerolactone (GVL) as solvent. While other technologies focus
    on the production of a single product from biomass, GVL?' ability to fractionate
    lignocellulosic biomass into its three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose,
    and lignin) at high concentration and purity, produce significant cost and technical
    advantages. GVL fractionation produces solid cellulose at high yield (>90%) and
    purity (>90%), without the need for pre-treatment or further chemical refining.
    This cellulose can be converted into dissolving pulp for high-end applications
    such as textiles (rayon), cellophane, or microcrystalline cellulose. The hemicellulose
    fraction does not need to be separated from the GVL and is readily converted into
    furfural within GVL at high yields (>75%) and high concentrations, minimizing
    separation costs. Preliminary mass and energy balances and techno-economic modeling
    based on lab data predict attractive financial returns. Tasks will focus on biomass
    fractionation to produce dissolving pulp, furfural purification, and GVL recovery
    at bench-scale. This experimental work will inform the engineering development
    for an integrated, continuous process, pilot demonstration unit."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to transform commercial construction through the democratization of scanning and automation of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to promote and improve the use of high quality video in products that the general public works with every day.  From high resolution auto dashboard cameras, to low latency video streams from flying drones, to wireless laptop docking stations, to higher quality coverage of news and sporting events, to better and faster delivery of video over the Internet, every application requires the high quality, low latency, flexible, power efficient video encoders that will be developed in this project.  The uses of video are increasing every day.  Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals.  Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards.  It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years.  Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).  An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function.  It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform.  The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used.  The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop and commercialize a high resolution,
    protein-based retinal implant intended to restore vision to the millions of patients
    blinded by retinal degenerative diseases, particularly retinitis pigmentosa and
    age-related macular degeneration. These currently incurable and blinding diseases
    affect between 30-50 million people worldwide, and lead to a loss of independence
    for the individual, as well as an increased burden on their caregivers. While
    improved quality of life is the most vital outcome of this technology, reduction
    of medical costs of treating chronic retinal degeneration and limiting time with
    doctors will also be of benefit to the broad healthcare field.  The work outlined
    in this SBIR proposal also has the potential to significantly impact our understanding
    of retinal degenerative diseases, which will help in developing better and more
    effective treatments for a number of ophthalmic indications. The subretinal implant
    under development provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution
    retinal prosthetics, while offering a cost-effective solution to vision restoration,
    and will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality
    of life. \n\nThe proposed project will expand on the data collected from the in
    vivo surgical development and ex vivo efficacy studies supported by our Phase
    I/IB awards.  First, a 40-animal rat study will be undertaken to further investigate
    the biocompatibility of the retinal implant.  Second, previously developed surgical
    procedures will be refined in pigs to ensure reproducible and safe subretinal
    implantation. Third, a high-throughput in vitro assay will be designed to investigate
    a number of implant parameters, as well as the integrity and biostability of the
    retinal implant using retinal pigment epithelial cells.   Additionally, medical
    device sealants will be investigated in this in vitro study, and the functional
    integrity of the implant will be measured using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy
    and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this
    application.  Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity
    to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution.
    \ These in vivo and in vitro studies are vital for the continued evaluation of
    biocompatibility, surgical feasibility, and efficacy of the implant.  The results
    from these studies will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology
    under development."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an online, fully automated platform for designing high-affinity antibodies for use as potential drug candidates. The success of antibody-based drugs has generated interest in faster and more efficient methods to discover and optimize antibodies. The goal of this project will be to develop and implement a computational method for producing protein sequences of humanized antibodies. This will be achieved by providing software that allows scientists to move some of their initial experiments into the cloud, and achieve results much more quickly by using computational methods saving time and cost for new drug development. In addition, it is anticipated that this will improve the features of antibody-based drug candidates, enhance the success rate of clinical studies, and accelerate the commercialization of new drugs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and implement computational tools for designing antibodies that are more effective, have fewer side effects, and have fewer problems in manufacturing. Current computational design methods rely almost entirely on the expertise of scientists iterating between experimental and bioinformatics approaches. An automated, systematic approach will help researchers design better antibodies with desired features in a shorter amount of time. The final platform will allow researchers to incorporate experimental and structural information to develop better drugs by determining which experiments will be necessary, assessing the viability of a potential candidate, and identifying structural features responsible for the molecule?s stability, immune response, and binding properties. The typical antibody design process takes many months and tens of thousands of dollars. With the aid of a computational process, this time can be cut back to the click of a button.

    grade students how to solve mathematical problems that seem difficult, maybe even
    hopeless at first. Problems, by definition, are hard to solve. They require intensive
    thinking and open-ended experimentation, which are often not possible in today's
    classrooms. In the software, an expert avatar takes students on math explorations
    in video-game-quality 3D where they visualize and discover eye-opening mathematical
    truths. The program helps teachers turn math into exciting explorations that students
    will love. For example, as students fly a jumbo jet from New York to Tokyo, they
    effortlessly discover methods for finding the shortest path between two points
    on the surface of a sphere, which is a difficult geometry problem. Teachers can
    easily fit the program into their daily instruction and get crucial details about
    the weak spots of each student. The joy of discovery is envisioned to increase
    students' interest in math, science, and engineering and to significantly reduce
    their math anxiety. Besides creating jobs and tax revenue, the project is expected
    to contribute to measurably improved math scores across the nation's 132,000 schools
    educating 58 million students. \n\nThe software being developed in this project
    is unique in that it emulates the natural style of communication between a student
    and an expert math teacher and immerses students in 3D virtual worlds where they
    develop deep mathematical insight and solve fascinating real-world problems. The
    program's ability to develop both mathematical content knowledge and problem-solving
    skills at the same time, as well as its capability to non-intrusively assess students
    during the mathematical explorations is also unmatched. During the Phase II project,
    the commercially viable software will be fully developed and its efficacy to improve
    students' mathematical problem-solving skills will be thoroughly researched. A
    pretest-posttest control group experiment will be conducted in authentic education
    settings to determine efficacy. The software's educational model and content may

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of genetically engineered tobacco plants that produce antibodies for the treatment of individuals infected with the Ebola virus. In the recent Ebola outbreak, a new antibody-based drug was shown to be effective in treating infected patients that was based on a transient tobacco-produced Ebola antibody cocktail called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc, San Diego, CA). Unfortunately, Mapp Biopharmaceutical's supply of antibody was quickly depleted, as the manufacturing method was not able to keep up with demand. The technological innovation in this proposal is the targeted production of antibodies within the gland cells of the tobacco leaf surface structures called glandular secreting trichomes. The research objectives will be to demonstrate the secretion of antibodies to the Ebola virus from tobacco trichome glands. The goal is to generate a line of N. tabacum plants that is optimized for antibody production in plant trichomes to provide a biomanufacturing platform for the large-scale production of antibodies that may be used in the treatment of Ebola infection, and in the future, other diseases.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use a recently developed plant-based biomanufacturing system to scale-up the production of antibodies to the Ebola virus for use as a therapeutic treatment. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has produced a drug based on antibodies to the Ebola virus produced in a tobacco plant transient gene expression system.  Using this system, they have identified a glycosylated antibody variant (glycoform) with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Using glycosyl-transferase knockout lines of N. benthiamiana and transient expression strategies, the company utilizes plants to produce glycosylated antibodies that produce optimal recruitment of natural immune effector cells (Olinger et al., 2012). Other expression hosts (Chinese hamster ovary cells, yeast) yield product with reduced potency, and are not suitable alternatives. To recover active antibody with their current plant expression technology, Mapp Biopharmaceutical must destructively harvest plants, and isolate antibody from plant tissue homogenates. Unfortunately, this method has not been able to produce enough antibodies to satisfy the demand.  The proposed method will allow for the production of antibodies in tobacco plants in large scale.  In addition, the proposed system will use antibody harvesting strategies that do not require destructive homogenization as the antibodies will be secreted onto the surface of the leaf, and recovered by washing. The goals of this project are to increase the functionality of plant-produced antibodies, scale-up production, and reduce the costs of production further through system optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will enable a group of customers we call Risk Pricers (specifically, property and casualty insurance underwriters and mortgage bankers in financial firms) to profit from tailoring pricing on their products. They can do this by rapidly predicting financial losses for buildings having specific configurations, using the software developed in this proposal. These customers can then tailor pricing of earthquake insurance and mortgage terms based on refined analyses that we facilitate. Besides offering a clear financial benefit to Risk Pricers, this new analysis approach will also fundamentally change market forces and incentives around building safety. If a building's owner is incentivized to improve its earthquake performance (via lower insurance and mortgage costs), then high-performance buildings become more appealing and this will encourage design of better buildings. As the company's software makes more explicit the links between building properties and financial costs, society will benefit from more efficient resource allocation, ultimately leading to increased societal resilience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop algorithms and software tools that provide financial guidance to customers interested in repair costs and closures of buildings due to earthquakes.  To complete the development of its tool, the company will focus on calibrating statistical models to predict displacements and accelerations in a wide range of building types, when they are subjected to earthquake shaking. The company's method for rapid estimation of structural responses utilizes principles of engineering mechanics, but applied in a domain where academic research does not focus (i.e., estimating response of a structure whose properties are not fully known to the analyst). The key identified need is to calibrate a statistical predictive model for the response of a structure that is effective over all popular construction types of interest to customers in the insurance and mortgage banking markets (i.e., light frame wood, steel, concrete, concrete tilt-up). The company will also develop loss metric and calculation outputs that incorporate insurance contract conditions such as deductibles and limits, in order to link the calculations to customers' workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer electronics market
    (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance, low power, small footprint
    multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices, are all directly microfabricated on a common
    ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and
    processed using machine learning algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to
    exceed $6 billion dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to
    reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion market. This can have
    a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with mobile platforms, can be used to
    monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these solutions affordable will make it amenable to low
    income households not only in the US but also around the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of
    knowledge such as in digital sensory systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.

    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale microfabrication of
    Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
    substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and
    accelerometers, are pervasively used in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however,
    requiring higher device performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on
    the same package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by monolithically
    fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e-
    Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to
    implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as
    no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing
    low noise and higher performance. Phase II tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate an inertial measurement unit that is
    monolithically integrated with its ASIC with optimal performance parameters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be high performance error correction for flash memory. Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that  can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of  techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project in the long term has two main components.  First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings.  And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology.    This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions.  The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs.  These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material.  MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application.  This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials.  Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date.  The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas.  The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can be found across the semiconductor industry with its initial market in wireless communications.  Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range. CNTs have unique and highly desirable properties ranging from superior mobility to current carrying capability to thermal stability.  Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide.  Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices. This work will enable cost effective wafer scale growth of devices which exploit the groundbreaking linearity that CNTs can deliver.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly reducing global carbon emissions using vacuum insulating glass. Vacuum glass is like a flat and transparent thermos bottle for windows. Vacuum glass has three times less heat loss than triple pane glass but costs no more to manufacture.  This disruptive value proposition will drive rapid market penetration, regardless of energy price, and without the need for government subsidy.  This project will produce vacuum insulating glass that will enable R-10 windows, consistent with the goals and schedule of the DOE Windows Roadmap.  Immediate benefits include improved occupant comfort and reduced heating bills without thermostat setback. Furthermore, vacuum windows will be condensation-free and fog-free forever. The potential impact is huge. Buildings represent 40% of total U.S. carbon emissions. Near-universal use could reduce total U.S. energy use by 3% (about 3 quadrillion BTU/year), while adding no cost to building infrastructure. Germany, Japan, Australia, China, and Russia have vacuum glass development programs; a successful development under this project will ensure that the U.S. stays at the scientific and technological forefront of this technology, and participates in a large and growing market.




    This project will develop the use of plasma degassing to achieve a vacuum life beyond 20 years, a condition for private investment. Without adequate degassing, moisture attached to internal surfaces is trapped at the time of seal-off. Trapped moisture molecules will later outgas, causing vacuum decay. Traditional high-temperature bakeout is too costly for affordable vacuum glass. Bakeout takes hours, but plasma degassing takes minutes. A German vacuum glass development effort tried plasma degassing under vacuum, which is inefficient. In contrast, this project will use atmospheric pressure plasma degassing, which is both faster and cheaper. Building on lessons learned during the Phase I project, a plasma treatment protocol will be developed to produce VIG panes as large as 25% of the average residential window size.  Working in parallel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will work to optimize the insulating performance of the design to enable an R-10 window for the DOE Windows Roadmap. Thereafter, an integrated pilot line will be assembled, able to produce vacuum glass units suitable for meaningful retrofit projects. Finally, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will conduct accelerated life testing. Independent life data, combined with a successful operating pilot line, will help secure private investment for commercialization.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to produce colostrum proteins in edible
    green algae that have the potential to reduce the use and dependence on antibiotics
    in livestock animals. Colostrum proteins have both beneficial health and growth
    properties that may drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics. Unfortunately,
    there is a limited supply of colostrum. Algae provide an affordable and scalable
    system for the production of the valuable proteins found in colostrum. Recently,
    it was demonstrated that the use of antibiotics in livestock animals caused the
    formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Colostrum proteins naturally stimulate
    the animal's immune system and allows them to improve their own ability to fight
    off infections and ultimately increase their rate of weight gain. The production

    SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing colostrum
    proteins in algae using biomanufacturing. Some of the problems associated with
    having the animal livestock industry adapt a new product is demonstrating cost
    and feasibility. To accomplish the goal of decreasing antibiotic use, this project
    will first focus on optimizing the production process to drive the cost of producing
    colostrum proteins in algae down. Next, work will be done on developing optimal
    formulations of colostrum proteins and testing them in mice models before moving
    to larger livestock animals. Once an optimal formulation is established, trials
    will be done in pig models. In the pig models, colostrum proteins produced in
    algae will be tested to determine their ability to assist animals in fighting
    off infections and also their ability to improve the animal's rate of weight gain.
    Finally, this project will strive to demonstrate that colostrum proteins produced
    in algae can give the same positive outcomes in animals when compared to animals
    given antibiotics. By accomplishing these goals, algae colostrum proteins can
    drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics and their negative side effects."

    Research Phase II project includes applications ranging from peak load shifting,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the ability of the haloacetic acids (HAAs) analyzer proposed here to change how superintendents of drinking water utilities go about understanding their drinking water treatment plants. The HAAs analyzer will allow superintendents to continuously map, monitor and then optimize their drinking water treatment practices using detailed and high quality measurements on the federally-regulated HAAs, which are carcinogens. Optimizing of the water treatment practices using the HAAs analyzer will reduce chemical usage (save money) while simultaneously providing the highest quality drinking water for their customers by minimizing HAAs. The commercial U.S. market for Drinking Water chemicals, contract operations, consulting/engineering, instrument and testing is $19.3 billion. The entire U.S. Water industry market is $86.4 billion. The major target of this proposal is the 28,643 traditional community water systems serving 90 % of the U.S. population. Some water systems struggled to meet Stage 1 Disinfection By-Product (DBP) regulations. Stage 2 of these regulations is stricter. The DBP regulations address long-term (decades' timescale) exposure to HAAs. Superintendents can use the proposed HAAs analyzer to understand hourly, short-term variations in their treatment plants to enhance long-term minimization of HAAs.



    This project will commercialize the first state-of-the-art instrument for fully automated, on-site process monitoring of the drinking water disinfection by-products known as haloacetic acids (HAAs). The HAAs analyzer proposed here has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment through reduction of treatment chemical usage at the water treatment plant while simultaneously improving and stabilizing water quality with respect to the carcinogenic and federally regulated HAAs. Currently, most drinking water treatment plants use contract laboratories to determine HAAs concentrations in the distribution system. This approaches can take 2 - 3 weeks to return the results at a significant expense for the equivalent hourly data provided by the proposed HAAs analyzer. The research objectives for this Phase II SBIR proposal are to develop components for the HAAs analyzer to enable long-term, maintenance free operation with minimal operator intervention. Simultaneously, costs will be reduced for both construction and operation of the HAAs analyzer to establish commercial feasibility. The anticipated results will be a HAAs analyzer that will provide water treatment personnel individual and Total HAAs concentrations once per hour, on-site and automatically.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the democratization of manufacturing through democratization of design and simulation technologies.  Geometric design systems and CAD tools are now widely available as standalone systems or cloud-based services, but simulation technologies remain inaccessible due to high cost, tedious data preparation, and demand of expertise in structural simulation. This project aims to make structural simulation widely available to both novice and expert users as a low cost fully automated service that requires no preprocessing or data conversion. The cloud-based simulation service is a disruptive technology that will make structural simulation widely available to communities of makers, as well as manufacturing enterprises, leading to dramatic improvements in performance, manufacturability, sustainability and cost savings. Wide adaption of simulation tools is also an important ingredient of STEM education and workforce development.


    This project will address the technical challenges identified in Phase I of the project, focusing on the goal of making cloud-based structural simulation service easily accessible and widely used. The key ingredients of the proposed approach are: (1) Development of novel user interaction modes and scenarios that enable rapid creation, composition, and editing of structural simulations by novice and expert users; (2) Guided interactive interpretation and exploration of simulation results aimed to not only to convey and explain simulation results, but also to engage the users into improving their designs by creating improved simulation scenarios. (3) Context-integrated simulations, where automated simulations are fully integrated with other services and delivered seamlessly within the context of common design or manufacturing applications, such as shape design, 3D printing, or manufacturability analysis.

    oscillation technique (FOT), where an acoustic pressure wave is sent via the mouth
    to a patient's lungs and reflections are used to measure lung function. Thus,
    no special breathing maneuver is required from the patient. Cognita Labs will
    adopt a modular approach for product design, and develop product-caliber advanced
    and integrated devices, that will include hardware, tablet app and EHR integration.
    The design will include all the innovations developed during Phase I to reduce
    the device size and cost while increasing its measurement accuracy. The proposed
    device will further develop and integrate a new ultra-sound based non-invasive
    sensor into the device to significantly reduce the cost of the consumable (disposable
    mouthpiece) and ultimately the cost of test. The team will also develop a new
    multi-resolution pre-screening test, with the objective to reduce bench time in
    outpatient clinics."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project focuses on developing an accessible educational
    platform that combines mobile interfaces and adaptive educational tablet applications
    (Apps) to support the needs of children with special needs. Tablet devices are
    known to provide an interactive experience that has revolutionized learning for
    children. Unfortunately, while these tablet devices are intuitive to utilize and
    easy for many children, those with disabilities are largely overlooked due to
    difficulties in effecting pinch-and-swipe gestures. This project thus addresses
    a direct need in our society by providing an integrated educational experience,
    focused on math education that addresses the diverse needs of children, while
    providing a solution for variations found in their disabilities. The contributions
    of this project include 1) the design of accessible math Apps usable by K-12 children
    with and without disabilities and 2) the design of apps that adapt educational
    content and provide feedback to parents and teachers based on real-time analytics.
    Given that there are over 93 million children worldwide living with a disability
    and, in the United States, children with disabilities are entitled to a free appropriate
    public education, there is a large potential of making both a commercial, as well
    as a societal, impact in this space.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project addresses
    an unmet need by developing an innovative solution to enable children with motor
    disabilities access to mobile devices and Apps that could engage them fully into
    the educational system. This solution capitalizes on the availability of pervasive
    technologies by combining an accessible tablet interface and educational Apps
    that adapt to each child?s abilities in order to provide an accessible mobile
    solution. Tablet devices are known to provide an interactive experience that has
    revolutionized learning for children. Unfortunately, while these tablet devices
    are intuitive to utilize and easy for many children, those with motor limitations
    tend to have difficulties due to the fine motor skills required for interaction.
    As such, to address the growing utilization of tablets in the classroom environment,
    the specific research objectives of this effort include the design of methods
    that enable the embedding of educational math content into accessible tablet apps
    for training and evaluating cognitive skills, the design of methods that enable
    adaptation of the educational content based on real-time analysis of interaction
    data and correlated performance of the child, and the hosting of interactive design

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue the development of a family of new nanostructured conductive additives for use in high-performance coatings and composite resins. Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem in a number of vehicular applications, which increasingly utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials.  Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. The design of lightweight vehicles using composite materials, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation.  In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles.  Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of the proposed antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies.

    The new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the conductive properties of the coating are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability. In this Phase II effort, we will further optimize these additives, based on key customer requirements, and develop a plan to scale up their production tenfold with reduced waste and production time.  Corrosion properties for marine applications will also be evaluated, and the product portfolio will be expanded to address follow-on applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses the issue that while mobile devices hold great promise for education, most of the kids' apps that claim to be educational ultimately amount to little more than brain candy. Furthermore, the few apps that are based on educational research are resource-intensive to develop and therefore have limited opportunity to scale their success. This project is building an educational platform that addresses the problems of both quality and scale in this market. It is creating a content enhancement system designed specifically for creating research-based educational content that allows developers and content studios to build mobile and web apps at a fraction (10%-20%) of the cost of traditional app development. The content built using this system is automatically integrated with analytics and personalization technology that tailors the content to each child based on the child's responses. The personalization technology applies methods from psychometrics and cognitive development to ensure that the content adapts to the child and facilitates learning in an engaging way. The project will deliver a large library of context-based and personalized learning content for preK and primary grades that parents know is based on sound research, and ultimately helps increase school readiness and learning outcomes. Given the growing demand for age-appropriate mobile educational content for children, this project has the potential to generate significant returns as a commercial enterprise and, importantly, through the economic gains resulting from improvements in educational outcomes. It will also give content developers the opportunity to economically develop and deploy new content that uses personalization technology, without having to build this complex technology themselves, thereby applying this innovation at a large scale.

    This SBIR Phase II project is building a mobile game-based learning platform to onboard high quality third-party children's educational content and enhance their effectiveness through analytics and personalization. To achieve this, the project is developing two significant technical innovations: (1) a cloud-based personalization engine that powers adaptive learning in varied educational contexts and (2) a content enhancement system to efficiently and economically enrich third-party children's content (in the form of digital assets, books, or videos) with interactive learning games that are powered by the personalization logic. The personalization engine will use machine learning techniques combined with statistical methods of psychometric assessment and principles from cognitive development. It will inconspicuously measure children's interaction with the proposed platform's educational content and dynamically adjust game-play to suit each user's individual skills, interests and educational needs. The proposed model of leveraging and augmenting the efforts of many content developers is a dramatic departure from existing content development paradigms in this space. The goal of the project is to substantially increase the scale and reach of personalized, research-based learning experiences on mobile devices and ultimately maximize the potential of modern technology to deliver dynamic learning experiences.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project derives from the fact that increasing the reliability and robustness of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) will directly increase their adoption in real world applications. CPS technology is directly applicable to a broad range of sectors, including utility grids, smart buildings, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, etc. These sectors account for more than $32.3 trillion in economic activity, with the potential to grow to $82 trillion by 2025 - about one half of the global economy. CPSs are thus critical to the national interest in areas such as manufacturing competitiveness, defense, health care, energy production and usage, and disaster monitoring and recovery. Due to the increasing reliance on CPSs in the future, system defects could have drastic consequences. The proposed technology could significantly improve reliability of CPSs by catching defects before they result in significant loss, outages, or failures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an efficient remote monitoring and diagnostic software system to detect and diagnose software defects in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CPSs have the potential to bring about a revolution in efficiency, robustness, and safety in application domains such as smart utility grids and smart healthcare. To unleash their potential, CPSs must themselves be robust. However, despite state-of-the-art testing, software defects currently do escape into deployed CPSs. Current state-of-practice monitoring and diagnostic systems cannot improve the situation as they were not designed with the constraints of CPSs in mind, which include real-time execution, unreliable links, and resource constrained processors. The proposed technology is aimed at creating a software system capable of monitoring embedded nodes in CPSs for anomalies and providing detailed execution information to quickly diagnose the software defects responsible for any anomalies. The proposed work extends the company's extensive research in efficient collection of information for diagnosing software defects. The company expects to create a monitoring and diagnostic software system for CPSs and demonstrate its effectiveness on existing software defects in CPSs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is significant; transitions of care impact millions of Americans every year. The healthcare system bears substantial cost and inefficiency&#8232;on account of suboptimal care transitions and overspending. This Phase II project will support progress towards a "learning healthcare system" and will extend the capabilities of data mining and machine learning in healthcare

    The proposed project seeks to improve data mining technologies for healthcare decision support. This project will focus on the analysis of a broad variety&#8232;of data types that are common in healthcare settings. The anticipated improvements would allow frontline care staff, operational managers, and healthcare executives to assess and make stronger evidence-driven decisions regarding quality, cost, and access as patients move through the healthcare system. The enhanced data mining system would utilize state-of-the-art pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to dynamically process and interpret clinical, claims, and other types of healthcare data. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics.

    explore the applicability of a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GD-OCM)
    instrument to image and evaluate optical materials as part of the manufacturing
    process.  The immediate broader impact of this project is to effectively provide
    both qualitative and quantitative information about product quality in manufacturing,
    with an initial focus on contact lens manufacturing. Providing high-speed, industrial,
    micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions, GD-OCM enables contact lens
    manufacturers to replace multiple inspection steps with a single measurement done
    automatically, reducing the opportunity for damaging the samples and human error,
    and ultimately leading to increased productivity and yield.  The resulting improvements
    in contact lens performance and extended wear effects are poised to have a positive
    impact on a significant percentage of the population.  Recent evaluations of GD-OCM
    have indicated its ability to provide a new wealth of characterization methods
    for quality control of various materials that are otherwise impossible to characterize
    nondestructively, including gradient refractive index polymers, glass and layered
    structures.  Additionally, GD-OCM will enable new advances in a wide variety of
    scientific fields via its capability to non-invasively optically section samples
    of a variety of material types. \n\nThe objective of this Phase II project is
    to establish the effectiveness of the emerging GD-OCM technology for nondestructive
    on-line metrology of contact lenses in manufacturing. Quality control and detection
    of product-significant defects, and a corresponding increase in production yield,
    represent the value proposition for the introduction of GD-OCM instrumentation
    into the contact lens production environment. The project will result in two major
    outcomes: 1) implementation of a robust production-environment instrument to effectively
    provide micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions and quantification
    of yield-relevant contact lens quality metrics not previously available in a single
    instrument; and 2) demonstration of the technology for inspection in a production
    environment to rapidly and accurately monitor defects and quantify contact lens
    quality using product relevant metrics. This nondestructive, on-line optical inspection
    system can have significant impact not only on the process control and thereby
    yield of contact lenses, but also in manufacturing of layered materials in general,
    including polymers, plastics, and glass. Longer-term, the technology offers new
    paths for tissue imaging, guided surgery, and monitoring of eye disease."

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to discover digital methods to personalize reading instruction such that students understand more when they read, retain knowledge, and build lasting skills. The academic research on reading supports the claim that active reading strategies that incorporate quality instruction can benefit students. However, instruction is usually not personalized to meet the needs of specific students, and even when an educator works 1:1 with a student they can only interpret a limited number of signals from a student to help guide instruction. The objective of the project is to take in several inputs when students read digitally and investigate whether personalized reading instruction can effectively be created and delivered such that students get extra help when they struggle and are challenged when they can succeed on their own. Two-thirds of students in the U.S. are struggling readers; they cannot understand the main idea when they read. These students are four times more likely to drop out of school. People who read critically have more success in school, obtain high quality jobs, and are able to contribute more to expand social resources. Researchers and educators have been trying to solve the "reading gap" for decades, but only now does the technology exist to make this possible.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use unique machine learning techniques to personalize reading instruction. The algorithms to personalize instruction will ensure that extra help, or scaffolding, is allocated to the students who need it, and removed when they no longer need it or when it threatens to become a crutch. This approach is different than other machine learning algorithms, which are built to minimize the overall error or maximize the overall reward. However, what is required for personalized reading instruction is different. The algorithm must learn how much to help a student not so they perform better with help, but so they perform better without it because the goal is for students to become better readers in the long term, not become reliant on scaffolding to read. The objective of the research is to fully develop and commercialize this personalized reading system and will involve data science, application development, and content authoring.

    were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices

    to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false.
    New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations
    (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means
    that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction
    (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in
    conventional photonic crystal  and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is
    tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for
    hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints.
    The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the
    full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based
    photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important
    photonic components by the application of a powerful new gradient-free optimization

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are both technical and economic. The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to allow a greater number of organizations,
    businesses, and individuals to access shortwave infrared (SWIR) imaging technology.
    Modern SWIR technology has existed for more than 40 years, but its expense has
    limited its use to the military and large corporations; this project is grounded
    in the belief that when everyone has access to SWIR technology, the benefits to
    society are exponential.  SWIR image sensors have potential applications in food
    safety analysis (e.g., identifying harmful adulterated foods and revealing sub-surface
    flaws in produce), manufacturing (e.g., sorting), security (e.g., night vision),
    medical sensing (e.g., vein mapping and blood oxygenation monitoring), and the
    automotive field (e.g., night/inclement weather vision systems and for self-driving
    vehicles). A low-cost sensor will open the SWIR imaging market to players in these
    fields who have so far been shut out due to price. In addition, a low-cost, high-quality
    sensor will also make SWIR imaging directly available to the general public for
    the first time ever in the form of a SWIR camera smartphone add-on, establishing
    a new market for SWIR imaging. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase II project will produce low-cost germanium (Ge)-based shortwave infrared
    (SWIR) image sensors with features superior to those of currently available SWIR
    sensors. The research objective is to resolve issues of resolution, power usage,
    size, and sensitivity that limit advancement in the SWIR imaging field. This project
    will address these problems by utilizing a unique Ge-based SWIR sensor structure.
    In addition, a monolithic method of integrating the image sensor material onto
    the Si readout integrated circuit will be pursued. This will enable precise alignment
    of the readout integrated circuit  and the imaging device, which will lead to
    smaller pixel size and better resolution. Finally, issues of power use and sensitivity
    will be addressed through an innovative structure called Gate-controlled Charge
    Modulate Device. Research will focus on refining and improving the fabrication
    processes necessary to reliably produce low-cost, high-quality Ge-based SWIR image
    sensors."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly lowering the cost of high precision glass molding through a low-cost carbide-bonded graphene coating. In optical industry, optical glasses have been the de facto choice. These lenses are used in cameras, projection systems and military equipment. However, cost and other considerations frequently lead to the choice of injection molded plastic lenses with their acceptable but lower image quality. The innovative carbide-bonded graphene coatings are both low cost and durable, and could allow use of precision optical glasses in places where plastic products are used today. The coatings also have the potential to spread to other markets such as advanced thermal management, next generation electronic components, and biosensors based on the unique combination of excellent mechanical, physical, optical transparency and biocompatibility properties together with tunable optoelectronic characteristics. Such products may greatly improve our daily lives in areas such as portable electronics and optics, energy saving and green manufacturing.


    This project will further advance the chemically vapor deposited carbide-bonded graphene coating process demonstrated during Phase I that involved using silicon wafers with micro/nano-patterning. With the help of our industrial partners we now intend to scale the technology to the commercial level.  The process development is targeted to developing low-cost and mass-producible high precision glass molding, micro-optics, and NIR aspheric optics for cell phones and high performance laser collimators. These activities would also enhance our understanding of carbide-bonded graphene coating technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aligns with a major shift in healthcare to reduce hospital acquired infections. At a cost of over $1.5B and 600,000 extra hospital days in the US alone, surgical wound infection in high-risk abdominal surgery patients is a major healthcare burden. In addition, providers and hospitals face greater scrutiny of their wound infection rates today, and the sweeping changes of healthcare reform have incentivized these critical stakeholders to invest in preventative solutions. However, currently available solutions are insufficient, and existing surgical device companies have not developed a compelling pipeline of products to address this unmet need. The proposed technology enjoys a competitive advantage in that it operates in a relatively open competitive landscape, and its unique mechanism of action provides a comprehensive wound protection strategy. Thus, this technology has the potential to make a significant worldwide impact on wound infection, both from a healthcare quality and commercialization standpoint. The initial market for this technology is in colorectal surgery, with ample expansion opportunities into other abdominal surgical markets totaling over $1 billion.


    The proposed project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel technology designed to prevent one of the most frequent, morbid, and costly hospital-acquired infections: surgical wound infection. The technology is an innovative surgical tool that provides a comprehensive anti-contamination strategy for the wound that is also user-friendly for the surgeon. This device has the potential to be a transformative innovation in the quality of surgical care, particularly in the 3.5 million patients undergoing high-risk abdominal-gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in whom wound infections are the most common. The technology also allows surgeons to experiment with a variety of approaches to identify ?best practices? for intraoperative wound care. This Phase II project proposes three main objectives. First, the company will refine the scientific understanding of the local and systemic therapeutic of the anti-contamination therapy through numerical modeling and pre-clinical testing in a porcine model in order to provide clinical use recommendations. Second, the company will design and develop a product sized for laparoscopic surgeries in order to support a broad-based commercialization effort. Third, the company with develop scaled manufacturing capability to support commercial release of the CleanCision product platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project derives from an enhanced capability for automated processing of free text and other structured data.  Motivation for this approach comes from neural networks and, in turn, it has applications to neural modeling and our understanding of how the brain processes information.  In the software industry, commercial innovation continues to revolve around automated processing of web pages, which plays a key role in creating many new companies.  Therefore, the ability to automate decision-making from free text is increasing in importance. A better way to represent text for use with machine learning will open new capabilities wherever the structure of sentences must be taken into account.  This has the potential to lead to new startup ventures, thereby resulting in new products and services. A successful project will result in platform technology that can provide a substantial competitive edge to companies that take advantage of it, provide new and better capabilities for consumers, and help advance the nation's lead in technological innovation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop new ways to process textual material so that computers can better learn applications related to natural language.  Applications include sentiment analysis (assigning either positive or negative views to a body of text), summarization of documents, and classification of documents using multiple labels from a fixed set of many classes.  The project will further develop new techniques to improve performance, and prototype components for transforming text and applying computerized learning methods. The new techniques represent words simultaneously with document structure using a single high-dimensional vector (for example, a list of 1,000 numbers).  The project is aimed at improving computational capabilities involving documents, web pages, and other text as well as providing new techniques that can be applied to automated translation, better computer understanding of images, and genomic information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from lowering the barrier to entry for, and simplifying the use of, cloud computing systems via a novel, open source, cloud platform.  The proposed advances have the potential to facilitate and expedite innovation and technological progress by a diverse software and global developer community, enabling more people to tackle the important yet increasingly challenging and data-intensive computing problems facing businesses today. The company's technologies address directly the key pain points of this explosively growing platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and cloud-based application development market - namely privacy, lock-in, and control.  Unique to the company's approach is compatibility with a leading, proprietary, public cloud PaaS standard (Google App Engine).  As such, the company's solutions have significant commercial potential because they are directly applicable to businesses that employ App Engine today (there are currently over 4.5 million active applications), and they lay the groundwork for addressing the larger PaaS market in the long term.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is based on a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) via automation, thereby relieving developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so.  The proposed technology advances address the issue of vendor lock-in - i.e. the use of proprietary technologies, services, and systems that effectively prevent users from switching to alternative vendors.  In the cloud space, lock-in is proliferated through the use of (i) proprietary interfaces and tools, (ii) complex pricing models, and (iii) the lack of interoperability across vendors.  The proposed technology disrupts lock-in by public cloud vendors by automating software deployment and management across clouds, and by making it easy to move applications and data between vendor offerings and on-premise clusters. In particular, the company's technologies abstract away the complexities of cloud use, and provide monitoring, backup/restoration, and migration of applications and data across clouds at the push of a button.  By providing features that are currently unavailable today, the proposed technologies have significant potential for reducing the cost, risk, and learning curve associated with cloud-based development, deployment, disaster recovery, and migration for the next generation of cloud applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in detecting sepsis early in its course, before end organ damage when it is most treatable. Sepsis, an uncontrolled systemic response to local infection by bacteria or fungi, is responsible for more deaths than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined and is associated with ~$17B in annual U.S. healthcare expenditures. We anticipate that providing emergency department physicians with an earlier diagnostic will profoundly influence clinical outcomes (currently ~40% mortality), costs (>$22,000/case), and the quality of life for survivors and their families. Accumulating evidence connects systemic immune activation ? a key process in sepsis ? with single-cell architectural changes that are mechanically measured by high-speed mechanical phenotyping technology. This technology is well-suited for adult sepsis screening in the emergency department (market size of $1.5B) due to: (1) the functional analysis of cell state the mechanical measurement provides, (2) its high achievable throughput and therefore statistical accuracy, (3) exceedingly short turnaround time, (4) low cost of goods, and (5) the clinically-actionable information it provides. Beyond the adult sepsis screening market, several additional indications include neonatal sepsis, bladder cancer detection, academic research tools, and drug development.


    The proposed project brings an innovative new class of biomarkers to bear on a problem that has been intractable with current biomarkers.  Briefly, the physical properties of cells have been known to be important for decades, but only with the advent of breakthrough microfluidic technology have we been able to measure these parameters in a high-throughput manner capable of diagnosing disease.  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award will be used to develop and validate innovative sample preparation and image analysis modules for a sepsis screening technology as well as performance of proof-of-concept clinical studies that would be a flagship offering in using biomechanical biomarkers to diagnose disease. The technical objectives are designed to improve sensitivity to white blood cells, activated during sepsis, by microfluidic automation of sample preparation and optimization of the microscopic imaging optics. In addition to preparing the test for practical implementation in the emergency department, the test will be validated with a proof-of-concept clinical study, and a clinical scoring system will be devised.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase the efficiency of identifying, mapping, and remediating water sources contaminated with chlorinated solvents.  Chlorinated solvents are used in vast quantities as solvents and degreasing agents, and in the dry cleaning industry. The necessity of monitoring chlorinated solvents in water will continue for many generations due to their widespread occurrence in water sources around the world, their toxicity, and their high stability. A significant need exists and will grow for devices that can continuously measure the concentration of chlorinated organic chemicals in water, and that can do so accurately and inexpensively. Continuous in-situ data production in the field of environmental sensing will greatly increase efficiency in all processes that require a measurement of these chemicals, having a significant impact on the costs and timelines associated with remediation of contaminated sites. This sensor will allow for continuous monitoring of possible contamination sources in the case of a contamination event. Also, it will afford easy profiling of contamination plumes in aquifers. This technology will replace the current laboratory-based measurement protocols, which are not readily adapted for in-situ, on-line, or in-the-field measurements, and cannot produce data continuously.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an optical enzymatic biosensor for continuous, quantitative monitoring of chlorinated solvent concentrations in water. Chlorinated solvent contamination of groundwater is a widespread ongoing issue around the world. The biosensing concept will be implemented in an optical fiber format, in which optical biosensor tips are linked to a small electro-optical unit. Analyte detection takes place on biosensor tips that are coated with enzymes and fluorescent chemicals. The scope of the research includes two parallel strategies for obtaining highly stable detection enzymes such that long lifetime sensors are achievable, development of a system to deliver required reagents to the sensing tip, development of signal processing algorithms to enable high accuracy measurements in variable environmental conditions and speciation of chlorinated compounds within mixtures, a manufacturing study for high throughput fabrication of the sensors, and field testing of the device at multiple contamination sites. Attainment of these objectives will advance the sensing technology to a robust and readily manufactured system for chlorinated solvent monitoring with low detection limits, high accuracy, and reliability.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at reducing the impact of knee arthritis and improving the quality of life for those suffering from this debilitating condition, while simultaneously strengthening the bond between academia and industry by providing students with unique research opportunities through the development of a novel Total Knee Replacement technology.  Over 600,000 total knee replacement procedures are performed annually, comprising 8% of all Medicare spending.  Total hospital charges for this procedure approached $40 billion for 2012.  The revision rates for this procedure are significant: 10% at 10 years and 20% at 20 years.  Considering the aging population of the United States, the number of total knee replacements and revisions are steadily increasing and the majority of these will be completed under Medicare coverage.  The primary cause for revision surgery is loosening of the implants.  This innovation aims to develop an anchoring method for implantable orthopedic devices that will reduce the total number of revision procedures performed by creating a more stable interface between the bone and the device, and therefore enhance the scientific and technological understanding of orthopedic implants in general.

    The proposed project is a device that utilizes structural engineering principles such as load transfer and truss design to improve osteo-incorporation of a total knee replacement implant; such a device is likely to be more efficacious than current designs.  Currently available systems suffer from significant revision rates after being implanted only a short while.  With younger patients receiving these implants, devices need to be developed that will give the mobility and quality of life required by these patients.  The novel web structure fixing the tibial tray of a total knee replacement into the bone should provide improved initial fixation, reduce micro-motion, and eliminate aseptic loosening, all of which contribute towards a reduced revision rate and improved patient comfort.  After using the information gained from the Phase I SBIR investigation to inform computational models, the design of this device will be finalized.  The device will then be subjected to rigorous mechanical testing to investigate its performance in vivo, while simultaneously serving to satisfy the testing requirements mandatory for FDA approval.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will have immediate value for the pharmaceutical industry by accelerating research and discovery of new drugs, and also increasing production efficiency and safety. The technology also is applicable in many other sectors; e.g., monitoring natural polymers, such as dissolution of gelatin used in food or pharmaceutical applications, flocculation of impurities by water purification polymers, entrapment of oil by surfactants and other agents used in combating oil spills, and more.  The quantitative kinetics of molecular weight changes during all these processes will allow deeper understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical forces that drive them. Therefore, many commercial and scientific opportunities exist for the proposed technology, yielding the potential for significant impact across multiple industries. With demonstrated feasibility on applications in protein therapeutics and early adoption by several key users, the initial market for this technology and instrumentation could expand quickly, and sales could reach $10M within several years of delivering a commercial product.  The overall market for the technology will increase in time as other application sectors are developed.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a new technology for monitoring aggregation in therapeutic protein solutions, which will have wide-ranging impact in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Protein aggregation is a major problem across these sectors engaged in developing new protein pharmaceuticals. Protein aggregation can elicit immune responses against the protein itself, severely reduce bioavailability, and is a significant hurdle in the drug development pipeline. This new technology can simultaneously and quantitatively monitor the stability of many independent protein formulations for hours, days, months, or longer, all under the control of a single instrument and without any significant human intervention.  Because the technology is based on laser light scattering, it provides a rigorous means of monitoring the protein aggregation process.  It is based on fundamental laws of physics, and not on empirical or inferential means. The implementation and use of this technology could revolutionize drug discovery, formulation, and quality control dimensions and accelerate development of new drugs while making existing ones safer and more efficiently produced.  The technology can be used wherever proteins are under development for fighting diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and various forms of cardiovascular disease.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to significantly enhance reliability
    and security of critical network infrastructure, and ease network management tasks.
    Through multiple pilot deployments on live networks, a prototype version of the
    company's software tool has found a number of serious errors and vulnerabilities
    that were missed by existing state-of-the-art auditing techniques and monitoring
    tools, and was able to perform real-time network-wide verification within as little
    as one millisecond. When more fully developed under this project, the company's
    technology will help ensure highly available networking infrastructures. To this
    end the company will work with Urbana-Champaign Big Broadband (UC2B), a community
    network expected to provide gigabit fiber-to-the-premise to 2700 under-served
    residences and 350 community anchor institutions. The company will also work with
    the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), which is building a collaborative
    network environment to catalyze groundbreaking discoveries and innovation in emerging
    global networks. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
    will continue the development and commercialization of a new approach to analyzing
    and protecting computer networks. Every aspect of our society, from business,
    to government, to medicine and the sciences, is now tightly intertwined with the
    functioning of computer networks such as the Internet. However, modern networks
    are extremely complex, leading to a rich variety of failure modes and outages.
    These errors can result in very high costs for businesses, including lost revenue
    from SLAs, lost customers and contracts, fines for violating regulations such
    as HIPAA, leaks of sensitive information, and decline in corporate image. To address
    this challenge, the company is building a system that automatically verifies security
    and correctness of computer networks in real-time, discovers vulnerabilities,
    and assists network operators in determining their cause. The technology functions
    by scanning a network, constructing a formal model of the network's behavior,
    and using custom formal logic algorithms to automatically determine whether the
    network contains faults. It can vet networks continuously as the network state
    evolves, detect transient errors and signal immediate alarms, and scale to large
    and highly dynamic environments. It is intended to provide immediate practical
    assistance to network operators."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to wherever headphones are used to listen to sound. The first commercial markets targeted by the technology being developed are gaming, virtual reality and consumer entertainment. These are areas in which the US has strong market and technology leads. By the end of the project, the company intends to have developed software that can be licensed to major players in these areas, reaching tens of millions of users. Beyond these markets, there are many applications for spatial audio in human-computer interfaces to deliver spatial information along with the intended semantic message. Several niche markets also exist, such as data presentation/exploration via sonification and specifically designed auditory interfaces for vision-impaired users. Overall it is expected that the proposed R&D work will advance the state of the art in science and technology and will be of substantial value to society as a whole due to high usability, fidelity, naturalness, and portability of the developed spatial audio solutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop highly realistic and computationally efficient software for synthesis of personalized spatial audio, for applications that include virtual reality, gaming, and prostheses for the blind. Current algorithms are either perceptually unsatisfactory or have very high computational load. Approximate modeling of sound propagation, reverberation, and diffusion, along with tradeoffs between complexity and quality, will be explored using perceptual distortion metrics combined with the skills of professional listeners. The software will be optimized for use on mobile, console and embedded platforms. Additionally, a method to personalize the software to individual listeners, which was previously developed and tested in laboratory conditions, will be further refined and ruggedized for use in realistic environments. The expected outcomes will include a high-quality and efficient audio rendering library, a portable personalization apparatus, and several demonstrations that highlight the capabilities of the technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase the competitiveness of U.S. semiconductor industry by improving the quality of A/MS design verification, improving first pass design success and reducing time-to-market. Today, current analog verification methods and tools often fail to catch design mistakes, especially due to unforeseen interactions across chip subsystems, and these mistakes are a frequent cause of costly delays in bringing products to market even on chips where analog is only a small portion of the overall design ? a $63 billion market. The costs and lost profit potential related to multiple design versions can quickly run to millions of dollars and easily dwarfs the cost of providing designers access to the appropriate design tools. Using two different market analyses, the first using a digital verification market analogy and the second considering worldwide new (not slight derivatives) designs in just the AMS IC market, leads to an estimation of total available market for new analog verification solutions of $300 million annual revenue. Further extending the verification solutions with analytics and collaboration tools can potentially increase the market by a further 50% to $450 million annual revenue. Understanding A/MS verification coverage is a key component of this opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes a verification coverage system for analog/mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuit development. Verification of today?s complex integrated circuits and systems is widely acknowledged as a critical challenge to improving design productivity. Part of the verification challenge revolves around understanding what portion of the operating space has been examined; i.e., ?covered?. Today well-accepted formal and simulation-based techniques exist to capture and measure test coverage for digital integrated circuits, but there is no corresponding commercial capability for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Analog designers frequently spend too much time analyzing and over-testing system behavior for a small set of well understood usage scenarios while leaving significant portions of the state-space completely untested. The design exploration problem for A/MS circuits presents a critical challenge for implementing such systems due to the inherently large design space associated with these types of circuits. Key objectives for the project include productizing and extending key components demonstrated in the Phase 1 prototype. This project will deliver a commercial product to provide A/MS verification coverage data that is actionable and facilitates collaboration between design and verification teams. The resulting product will have scalability and performance to handle large complex designs.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    prototype, characterize, and verify performance merits and the commercial viability
    of an Adaptive Dual-Fuel (ADF) Injector. Diesel engines are 30~40% more efficient
    than port-injected gasoline, spark-ignited engines. Gasoline and E85 fuels are
    among the most widely available fuels, but are mostly used on spark-ignition gasoline
    engines with much lower thermal efficiency than diesel engines. The key innovation
    of the ADF injector enables direct-injections of both gasoline/E85 and diesel
    fuel selectively on-demand from a single injector. The ADF injector can enable
    advanced combustion modes that have demonstrated simultaneous reduction of NOx
    and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions and improved engine efficiency through advanced
    low temperature combustion. The advanced combustion mode enabled by the ADF injector
    can improve the thermal efficiency of gasoline/E85 engines by approximately 30~40%
    by using gasoline and/or E85 fuels in a compression ignition combustion mode.
    The adaptive dual-fuel injector also provides flexibility for enabling engines
    to run on either pure diesel, gasoline-diesel, or E85-diesel dual fuels. The Phase
    II work includes prototyping, spray visualization imaging and laser based measurements,
    computational optimization, and single-cylinder engine combustion testing to demonstrate
    the commercial viability of the proposed ADF injector. \n\n\nThe broader/commercial
    impacts of this project pertain to significant benefits for energy security and
    environmental protection. The potential customers include engine OEMs and auto
    makers. This project will significantly benefit US consumers through fuel cost
    saving, enable low cost methods to meet the new CAFE standards, and benefit the
    US economy by expanding the ?green? manufacturing base. The dual fuel injector,
    developed and analyzed in this work, provides new capabilities, which can enable
    transformative combustion methods for ultra-high efficiency, clean combustion.
    The industry-university collaborative engineering research directly support graduate
    student research and will train and educate the workforce of the future, providing
    them with the knowledge and skills needed to address the challenges of energy
    utilization. The research and development efforts, which focus on a critical problem
    of global importance, will be widely disseminated to engine designers, OEMs, and
    researchers, while the next generation of engineers is being trained."

    Ground Fluor Pharmaceuticals (GFP) developed proprietary single-step fluorination

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project anticipates bringing forth a disruptive mouth guard technology that answers the urgent need for better dental protection.  In the US alone, every year more than 1 million dental injuries occur, resulting in medical costs of roughly $500 million.  The proposed technology will involve novel manufacturing methods to incorporate energy absorbing solid/liquid suspensions into novel thermo-polymer mouth guard designs to achieve enhanced impact energy absorption capacity.  The specific technical objectives are to optimize the energy absorbing capacity of the formulated solid/liquid suspensions, develop the necessary manufacturing technology for incorporating such solid/liquid suspensions monolithically into the thermo- polymer, and finally to characterize the mouth guards by subjection to stress testing (chemical, physical, and thermal).  This energy absorbing mouth guard will deliver on-demand, tunable energy absorption capacity that can be specifically tailored to provide superior dental protection to users in several venues including medical, sports, industrial and military.  This R&D effort will produce the first ever mouth guard made with material that adaptively absorbs impact energy, a stark technological contrast to the conventional (passive) mouth guard.   This new technology will also contribute basic understanding to the emerging field of nanorheology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant.  In just the mouth guard arena, realizing this technologically advanced mouth guard will likely bring a novel product into the dental protection market. Then there is the untapped market to provide much needed dental protection for patients undergoing medical procedures. Yearly about 150,000 dental injuries occur just during endotracheal intubations, required when undergoing general anesthesia.  Further, the new energy absorbing fluid-thermopolymer material technology  to emerge  could  serve  as  the  technical  groundwork  for  a  plethora  of  energy dampening products.  In addition, the research stands to seed a new body of knowledge, small- scale (millimeter) leveraged use of energy absorptive fluids.   Realizing the technical objectives of this Phase II R&D effort will help foster local economic growth when the company?s new manufacturing facility opens for the fabrication of mouth guards based on this technology.  A large number of jobs will be created requiring very diverse technical skills, and the company is committed to fill these jobs with a diverse work force.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will determine the technical feasibility and the commercial value proposition for high temperature, highly processable fiber optic coatings across a range of markets to include fiber lasers, fibers for oil and gas, avionics fiber, and medical fiber. Tetramer will perform research to modify the structure of polymer coatings to provide enhanced performance which will extend the capabilities of current fiber optics. Coatings developed will advance our understanding of structure property relationships and establish new boundaries for the polymer system. During this program, Tetramer will synthesize new monomers and polymers and evaluate their properties for use as fiber coatings. At the end of this program, Tetramer anticipates it will have developed 3 new types of polymers with a set of performance characteristics which are not available from any one single material today. New fiber coatings will be developed which are capable of operating at temperatures above 300 deg C, having greater processability, and for laser applications, having lower refractive indices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will impact society in many ways due to the various markets in which the coatings can have a meaningful impact on the optical fiber performance. Fiber optic lasers are quickly becoming the preferred method for laser fabrication. By enabling fiber lasers to operate at higher temperatures, fiber lasers will immediately see increased output powers and longer service lifetimes. With applications in industrial metal working (welding, cutting, and engraving/marking), micromachining, and medical devices, doubling power output via improved coatings will have a major impact across many industries. Higher temperature fiber coatings will improve down-hole drilling and the overall efficiency of oil drilling operations through better temperature monitoring in deep wells. This has the potential to lower prices of oil and increase oil production. Additionally, these fibers can aid in geothermal well monitoring which would provide a green source of energy. The coatings under development have the potential to generate increased revenue and profit throughout the value chain through increased performance of products and enhanced market sizes through enhanced capabilities. Tetramer will also use this Phase II program to train undergraduate and graduate level students from nearby Clemson University

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the technology research and development necessary to bring wireless instrumentation and smartphone technology used for feedback to lower-limb amputees about their real-time performance, for rehabilitation in situ. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the opportunity to transform the field of rehabilitation and to advance healthcare by enabling a fundamental shift toward low cost, ubiquitous rehabilitation that can be used away from the clinic. This proposal will research and develop the pre-market alpha- and beta-prototypes of an instrumented insole, smartphone app, and HIPAA-compliant data transfer and remote server storage and analysis system, as an essential and transformative tool utilized for physical therapy and gait training outside of the clinic. While sensors have become small, inexpensive, and highly available, many research lab applications are limited to proof-of-concept evaluations that involve tethered systems and/or post-processing of the data. This research quantifies the effect of this low-cost, personalized, wireless assistive technology that can be used away from the clinic. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for more complex rehab feedback systems, e.g. using a smartphone to detect gait and provide feedback to an orthotic or prosthetic for muscle stimulation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the focus on mobility limitations in persons with lower-limb amputations, which affect twice as many minorities as Caucasians. The commercial potential of this wireless assistive technology is vast: with diabetes as the major contributor to amputations, the number of amputees is forecast to triple to 3.6 million by 2050. The knowledge gained can be expanded to impact individuals with a wide variety of mobility limitations, e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, etc. The orthopedic market ? 773,000 total hip/knee replacements performed annually in U.S. ? is also commercially relevant, as patients must affect an asymmetric gait following fracture repair or joint replacement to reduce weight-bearing on the healing limb. Another significant group are athletes seeking to improve performance or recover from injury through precision gait analysis and real-time feedback. In this Phase II proposal, this research will quantify the effect of this wireless assistive technology by enabling persons with amputations to use individualized proprioceptive feedback and to participate in the design of the personalized feedback methods. This work will enable a wealth of information collected away from the clinic, including a way to investigate how and whether patients follow treatment protocols.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    This STTR Phase II project supports standards-based math education in elementary school classrooms with a hands-on technology intervention. Research has shown that many elementary teachers suffer from low confidence and limited subject content knowledge in math and struggle to develop instruction designed to meet or exceed common core math learning goals. Teachers and researchers alike seek new approaches to engage students and improve teacher effectiveness to improve learning outcomes. The primary goal of this project is the development of a flexible, user-friendly, hands-on robotics kit with associated curriculum and support for teachers, that will engage students in learning math content, align with core curriculum, and measurably increase student achievement. The commercialization of this research-based classroom kit will enable school districts to adopt active learning into their math pedagogy. Ultimately, this promotes the NSF mission to increase national prosperity through science innovation by improving math preparation for students across the United States and preparing them to participate in careers that drive the advancement of science and technology.


    The core contribution of this work is composed of a flexible hardware kit to enable active learning within the core elementary curriculum as well as more traditional maker activities, and a suite of apps that allow students to use this kit to learn specific math content while also providing options to learn computational thinking through general purpose programming apps. To accomplish this, the team employs a proven design process in which hardware, software, and curriculum are simultaneously designed to align to learner goals, evaluated in classroom studies, and iteratively refined. The kit will combine the ease of use and simplicity of a regular snap-together style electronics kit with the flexibility of a programmable microcontroller. The apps developed for this project will build on a new math-based paradigm for robot programming. These math-oriented apps will remove the barrier of programming skills for elementary teachers and students alike when using the electronics kit for math instruction. Simultaneously, programming apps will enable open-ended explorations of making and computational thinking. Another contribution of this project will be the testing and analysis of the hardware system and complementary math curricula. Formative evaluation will enable exploration and understanding of novel mechanisms for learning math, and evaluation of the program's efficacy will enable characterization of the impact on student outcomes in math achievement and attitudes towards math.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a transparent, thin multifunctional coating for corrosion and biofouling prevention on coated surface. Its environmentally friendly product will be an efficient ready-to-use single component product that can be applied with ease, and would dry in ambient conditions without the need for external heating equipment. The global annual expenditure to mitigate corrosion is in the range of $2.5 trillion, roughly equal to 3.4% of the world's GDP. Protecting assets from corrosion is, hence, a critical requirement for all the industries. A broad range of applications can benefit from this coating technology such as aviation industry where removal of toxic chromium compounds from coating procedures is of high priority, automobile manufacturing where extended corrosion protection to vehicles without using toxic treatments is constantly sought, structural engineering where providing long life protection to bridges is always needed, marine engineering where protecting ships from corrosion and not contributing to ecological imbalance is long sought, military where minimizing the maintenance downtime of tanks and guns is of prime importance, hospitals that are interested in longer lasting medical implants, and paints and coating industry that is desiring removal of volatile organic components from their paints and coatings. The proposed coating is expected to offer scratch resistance and oleophobic characteristics in addition to corrosion protection. The initial success of this project will result in two high-volume products.


    This project aims to develop a specialized single-part, ready-to-use, nominally bioceramic liquid coating for protection against corrosion and fouling activities. On application over desired surface, this transparent liquid transforms into hard-yet-flexible coating. This thin coating composition consists of in-place generated nanoparticles of organometallic compounds in the 3D network of polysilsesquioxane. The reactivity of the precursor to coating is designed such that material can react with substrates in ambient conditions and dries to solid film without the need of any external heating. The hardened coating adheres to most surfaces including metals, ceramics, plastics, glasses, and wood. The optimum thickness of coating is approximately ten microns and can impart various desired surface functionalities to the coated object. In this project, efforts are directed towards optimization of current composition to be compatible with broad range of commercially available topcoat materials. The optimized coating composition will be subjected to a rapid properties screening before third party testing, validation and approvals. An extensive field testing will be conducted in collaboration with potential customers. This innovative coating technology will initially result into two products that can be used in place of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds that are currently in use for the corrosion protection of metals. While one of the products would act as a corrosion prevention compound that can adhere to commercial topcoat paints, the other would act as self-cleaning coating to prevent biofouling activities.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a video-based safety system for improving
    the quality and reducing the cost of dementia care. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects
    5.4M in the US, including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two
    thirds of all those affected by dementia. It is the single most expensive disease
    in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population
    with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest,
    currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations
    and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of
    4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed
    for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically
    for individuals with AD. The proposed system will change the quality of care and
    operations in memory care facilities, increase quality of life for patients and
    families, and help the medical profession gain a better understanding of dementia.
    \n\n\nThe proposed project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by
    detecting safety critical events, based on camera video where events can be reviewed
    by a human assistant in real-time and after the fact. It is expected to achieve
    two main objectives that advance science and technology: (1) Demonstrating the
    ability for our machine learning algorithms to automatically perform safety critical
    tasks, by learning over a sufficiently rich set of data. These extend existing
    methods for fall detection to include (a) fall prediction; (b) wandering detection;
    (c) bed sores detections; (2) enabling the Company to demonstrate that the system
    proposed can run with a fully operational HIL paradigm running at scale with up
    to 1000 patients in 100 memory care facilities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will usher new Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) products delivering high accuracy with explainability. Without rationale behind predictions, decision makers can't trust and effectively use AI/ML solutions.  Outcome of R&D through this project would lead to more accurate and faster detection with appropriate explanation of anomalous interactions and recommend effective controls to 1) eliminate billions of dollars of fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) in Health Insurance  markets;  2) lower costs, improve quality and speed of Health Care delivery to consumers; and 3) promote new markets in Personalized Health and Smart Health sector for  emerging Medical Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices and systems, enabling economic growth.  The results of this research are expected to enable the discovery of medical anomaly together with advancing the detection of new types of FWA. The boost in detection accuracy with explanation will save hundreds of millions of dollars. Societal impact includes reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers through better FWA control and advance health outcome through early medical IOT anomaly detection. More broadly, the system is expected to detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under/over-medication, advanced alerts for community health anomalies.

    The proposed project will extend and generalize a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance, coupled with explanatory capability providing rational behind predictions and operationalized in a distributed parallel computing framework for scaling. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities (e.g., doctors) with their attribute (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by combining relations between rows in the training data (e.g. doctors) with standard machine learning to improve prediction accuracy while facilitating local explanation. The result is vastly improved prediction accuracy with explainability. Thus, the method uses network information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa while facilitating explanation for a test case. This method is expected to significantly improve the ability to detect FWA and pave ways for multi Billion dollars savings, call out IOT-based medical anomaly in advance to improve health outcome and build trust in the predictions for the decision makers through the explanations provided. The team intends to deliver not only the accuracy boost with explainability, but a fully operational system with automated data pipeline, parallel and distributed algorithmic processing framework which can be deployed on a SaaS basis or an enterprise solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require additional care to fully recover - or simply to maintain their health - after being discharged from the hospital. Whether subacute or community-based care, significant opportunity exists to leverage machine learning, decision science, and advance data mining techniques to better support patients. State and federal budgets cover the costs of care for millions of Americans every year. This expenditure is growing faster than inflation, prompting the development of both optional and mandatory payment reform efforts that stand to simultaneously reduce costs and improve care outcomes. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon user-centered decision science in healthcare. The proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as claims/billing data from acute, subacute, and community care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continually refine and move towards production of this project's Creative Maker Tool, an augmented reality experience where the act of playing is inherently inventing. The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.


    The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen. Throughout this research, we will create and refine STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) Apps, which are built-in augmented activities where users create small inventions with everyday objects to code interactions and affect program flow or gameplay, develop Augmented Tutorials, bridge seamlessly to existing STEM tools through real-time interfacing, as well as manufacture and prepare the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.

    The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,  new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

    This SBIR Phase II effort will create transformative open tools to enable affordable access at scale to high quality assessments (problems & questions) for foundational subjects in secondary and post-secondary education. The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings.


    This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions.

    This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


    The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

    This SBIR Phase II Project aims to tackle the two greatest barriers to technology adoption associated with metal additive manufacturing (AM) - cost and quantities. Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.


    The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are numerous and include commercial, societal, environmental, and educational impacts. Commercially, an innovation of this magnitude would enable flexible design illumination, with great control over light placement, beam shape, stray light, and light pollution, all while decreasing the size and complexity of the optics and fixtures required. This will impact the amount of electricity used for lighting, helping to reduce global energy consumption, preserve our environment, and create economic and societal benefits. This project will also result in the employment several technical personnel to carry out the project's technical goals. Educational outreach will continue to impact the local community, students and researchers at nearby institutions, as well as visitors through seminars and workshops on solid-state lighting, materials research, and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the technical results may also inform future materials research in the development of robust materials, components, and device architectures with optimal properties to advance other areas of solid-state lighting research.

    The proposed project is aimed at achieving deployment of laser-stimulated phosphor technology for illumination in the commercial marketplace. Research in the field of solid-state lighting is advancing towards the goal of ultra-efficient and smart lighting. Exploring laser-stimulated phosphor emission could lead to next generation, energy-efficient light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies. Optical modeling and thermal simulations will be used to optimize the optics, phosphor materials, and device architectures to achieve narrow-beam angle, low-etendue, and high color-quality white light sources, while maintaining efficient operating temperature. Secondary components will be designed, including the electronics, packaging, heat sinks; compatibility tested with fixtures and manufacturing processes; and implementation into a light engine compatible in design and functionality with customer-specific applications. Regulatory, safety, and performance testing will be completed to achieve industry-specific standards, by working with regulatory bodies to test lifetime and durability in operating conditions, implementation of safety mechanisms, and photometric testing to ensure performance metrics. Lastly, planning, partnerships, execution, data collection, and reporting of field trail testing of products in real life conditions will result in a fully deployed and tested product, ready for implementation.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for
    use in 802.11ac/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications.
    5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
    technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral
    efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity.
    Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands,
    where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb
    antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and
    the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them
    commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array
    gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage,
    increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF
    nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment
    by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta
    prototypes of two MRA array modules containing the hardware and control algorithm
    that can be seamlessly integrated with WLAN and 5G small-cell modems.\n\nThis

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering barriers to innovation. Specifically, this project has the potential to improve the quality of healthcare around the world, by dramatically lowering the costs of designing and manufacturing biomedical devices.

    polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production-quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called ?functional lithography,? and it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to develop new advanced manufacturing processes using functional lithography, towards direct additive manufacturing of high-fidelity polymer components, devices and hardware.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop low-power, low-cost and small
    form factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived
    wireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place
    conventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and
    short battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project,
    items ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be
    connected to the Internet. Brands and manufacturers could gain previously inaccessible market and
    product insights based on the way products are used, while consumers could enjoy benefits ranging
    from new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products
    which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology
    can prompt innovation across many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range
    backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol
    which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this
    project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which
    provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting
    backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based
    radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible
    with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to
    address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter
    radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be
    addressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing.

    200,000 breast cancer patients in the US who elect lumpectomy annually, over 20%
    must undergo re-operation due to lack of clear margins. Furthermore, many breast
    cancer patients who are treated with lumpectomy require expensive adjuvant radiation
    therapy that can last up to 7 weeks causing time away from work and family. Fortunately,
    performing intraoperative RFA of the lumpectomy cavity has been shown to decrease
    the need for re-operations and radiation therapy by sterilizing tumor margins.
    However, no RFA devices are designed for post-lumpectomy breast cavities or breast
    tissue. The RFA system being developed in this project will automate post-lumpectomy
    RFA, accurately and precisely delivering energy based on local tissue properties
    and desired ablation depth in three dimensions thus customizing treatment for
    each patient. Eventual commercialization of this system could provide early stage
    breast cancer patients new treatment options that improve quality of life, reduce
    burdens of care, and costs while providing breast cancer recurrence control.   \n\nThe
    proposed project aims to develop a system (control unit and device) for optimal

    cavity for near-perfect tissue contact. The control unit includes advanced algorithms
    that utilize machine learning to create a three-dimensional ablation status map
    of each margin (ablation vs in-ablated) for controlling ablation. The combined
    system allows the surgeon to customize and monitor the three-dimensional ablation
    profile and automates therapy delivery to ensure accurate, precise ablation results.
    The objectives propose gathering device requirements, identifying critical tasks
    of an automated RFA procedure, and improving the system algorithm by collecting
    training data in cadaveric and prophylactic mastectomy specimens. The intellectual
    merits proposed are: (1) an automated ablation system implemented on an embedded

    back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation
    is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer
    from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional
    electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to

    \ Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects

    alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The

The amount of time they spend in direct care activities is a key determinant of patient satisfaction, better patient outcomes, fewer errors, and shorter lengths of stay. In the face of nursing shortages across the U.S., it is increasingly important to have nurses performing at the 'top of their license'. Reducing the amount of time they spend on non-nursing tasks is crucial to this goal. Automation could address these challenges and labor shortage by allowing clinical staff to focus on providing skilled care. The proposed project aims to develop technology that is general-purpose enough to transfer to other markets, such as long term care facilities and, eventually, individual consumers. Robots that perform assistive tasks in homes could increase the feasibility of independent living for many older adults.


    The proposed project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of developing hospital service robots that act as assistants on acute care units, enabling nurses to spend more time at the bedside with patients. This project will make technical advances along three dimensions: the ability of the proposed robot to autonomously navigate within nursing units and across the hospital (navigation capabilities); to easily adapt its manipulation skills to specific tasks and to physical characteristics of a particular hospital/unit (adaptive learning of manipulation skills); and to work alongside humans in a socially acceptable manner, including appropriate navigation in crowded hallways, speech, and eye gaze behaviors that communicate the robot's intentions (socially intelligent interoperability). The team intends to collaborate closely with a single partner hospital to iteratively improve the reliability and robustness of the artificial intelligence software suite developed with NSF funding and to deploy production-quality versions of the three core competencies. The final 6 months will involve a long-term deployment, with the robot autonomously working on an acute care unit of the partner hospital. The impact of the robot on unit staff and workflows will be documented, with the ultimate goal of developing a service robot that hospital staff view as a competent member of the care team.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable and support the future development, approval, and clinical use of new therapeutics the cure HIV-1 infection.  HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state.  This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection.  While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies.  To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.  This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.  Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete.  This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours.  Specifically, the project is focused on defining initial test performance and developing critical assay controls needed for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1.  Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be advanced to market to support research and early-stage clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

    This SBIR Phase II project should increase the adoption of pedagogically validated educational games that facilitate retention and effective use of business concepts taught and relevant to managing organizations. Start-ups, for-profit and nonprofit companies all need managers who can make effective decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty. It is of the utmost importance to society, therefore, that the next generation of business leaders is equipped with relevant frameworks and tools that supplement traditional teaching methods and enable effective use of knowledge on the job. Hence, this project has the potential to empower the U.S. workforce to be more productive and innovative, which will improve existing business outcomes and thus drive U.S. job and economic growth. Improved business operations will also lead to more profitable business in general and potentially larger tax revenues for the U.S. government. Eventually opening the GDL to third-party authors in the $18.6 billion global game-based learning market will accelerate game innovation and usage in other business and engineering disciplines at a lower cost, which will both enhance the effectiveness of the STEM workforce and encourage more economic activity in the game development market.

    This project is based on three innovations that differentiate this solution from others: (1) a scientific Game Research and Development (GR&D) process designs games containing pedagogical learning objectives; (2) a Game Design Language (GDL) accelerates implementation of game concepts as automatically validated, domain specific language while eliminating runtime errors; and (3) an innovative web Game Distribution Platform (GDP) minimizes the effort to setup and manage games in the classroom. Typical educational game development in languages such as JavaScript is time-consuming, involves professional software engineers and requires debugging of runtime errors, while usage of game technology in the class is disruptive to the flow of instruction. Such challenges are therefore prohibitive for non-professional programmers and game administrators such as professors. To mitigate the problem of runtime errors, this project employs methods of video game development, which typically use domain-specific languages based on non-Turing-complete models of computation to solve these issues. Games created with GDL will enable rapid new game development and have a guaranteed level of technical quality, allowing professors to focus on pedagogical relevance during instruction. The main technical hurdle is to tailor these methods to result in GDL capable of expressing the Operations Management (OM) games conceived during the scientific GR&D process and playable via the GDP that enables seamless class integration.

    This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

    Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in the development of a novel cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture footwear. Currently most footwear is mass manufactured, typically overseas, using fixed molds that do not meet the specific needs of an individual. 3D printing of footwear offers the promise of providing individual customization tailored not just to fit, style, and colors, but also to individual biomechanics and/or medical needs. However, a number of technical challenges exist to make 3D printing of footwear sufficiently cost-effective that it can be provided beyond just a select few individuals. This project develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture the critical components of footwear, using readily available and recyclable thermoplastic pellets. This novel 3D printing process will enable the manufacture of new, innovative footwear designs that cannot be made with any other manufacturing process. Additionally, it will make mass customization of footwear a reality, providing access to healthy customizable footwear for many individuals. Unlike traditional manufacturing processes currently being done overseas, this novel manufacturing technology is very amenable to implementing in the United States on a local level. Thus, this project will not only help move footwear manufacturing back to the United States, generating income for tax revenue, it will create entirely new clean, safe jobs in manufacturing.


    This project, led by a woman physician-scientist with a unique combination of expertise in both biomechanics and manufacturing, develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing technology to print a proprietary mix of elastomeric material into a novel sole design that was developed on the basis of over twenty years of biomechanics research. The primary innovation that is being developed in this project is a specialized plasticizing screw-based extruder mounted on a 3D printer, specifically designed to make footwear, that uniquely and reliably extrudes a recyclable, thermo-elastomeric material that is most suitable for footwear, from its most cost-effective raw form: pellets. This project also develops a novel healthy and customizable sole design, based on the principal investigator's biomechanical research, which can only be made with this manufacturing technology innovation. Finally, this project develops a biomechanically research-based algorithm for customizing footwear made with this technology based on an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or specific medical need. This project will allow for a novel, cost-effective manufacturing process where a bank of 3D printers operate simultaneously, each producing their own made-to-order pair of footwear and/or footwear components customized not only to fit but to an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or medical need.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to demonstrate the feasibility of Battery Resourcers recycling process on a scale that has commercial significance. This will further allow Battery Resourcers to scale its process such that it can be a player in the lithium ion battery recycling market place. Battery Resourcers' ultimate goal is into increase recycling rates of spent Li-ion batteries by providing an economically viable domestic recycling option.  Additionally, Battery Resourcers process produces low cost cathode materials for the battery industry which may ultimately further enable green technologies like solar, wind and electric vehicles.

    This SBIR Phase 1 award proposes to scale the Battery Resourcers recycling process from 50kg to 0.5 tons of spent Li-ion batteries. The proposed research focuses on process speed, safety and the quality of the recovered materials. Rate limiting steps in Battery Resourcers recycling process will be studied with an effort to improve process speed. Specifically, Battery Resourcers will look at new filtering methods for the solutions generated in its process. A method to safety shred Li-ion batteries is examined by controlling the atmosphere and removing the batteries' stored energy. Finally, the production of quality cathode materials from spent Li-ion batteries is scaled from 50kg to 0.5 tons.  Battery Resourcers' goal is to produce commercial quality cathode powder on a scale that matters to industry.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project was initiated as a direct result of extensive
    research into the US math crisis and the complexity of the problem. As a nation,
    we must invest resources directly into the breaking point: the mid school math
    cliff. The US shows the greatest decline worldwide from 4th to 10th grade on International
    tests in math. This project is designed to address all 146 Common Core State Standards
    (and all other state math standards) from 5th to 8th grade, providing a virtual
    reality context for each standard, embedded in an engaging, interactive 3-Act
    math story problem. The theoretical foundation of the project stems from Productive
    Failure, the concept that students perform better when they encounter productive
    failure prior to direct instruction in contrast to the reverse, where instruction
    is given first. Additionally, each simulator directly links student input to functional
    output to show how the math works, specifically allowing students to persist in
    exploring solutions. This project supports the NSF mission to support education
    for all fields fundamental to science and engineering, and holds the potential
    to positively impact a critical problem in U.S. education through broad commercial
    acceptance in schools throughout the US. \n\nThis project is designed to provide
    simulations in a virtual reality context for all standards from 5th to 8th grade,
    using a core software platform for delivery that can be ubiquitously used in classrooms
    throughout the United States. This high-risk technical innovation uniquely embeds
    math content in such a way that input leads to functional output such that students
    can see how the math actually works. Students watch the outcomes of their solutions,
    both the successes and the failures so they can try again. Math problems have
    context and meaning. Students experience the direct results of their mathematical
    abilities, while teachers have the ability to deploy specific problems and receive
    real-time metrics to further respond and support student comprehension. Underlying
    the advanced classroom technology is the pedagogical framework based on Productive
    Failure and the intentional withholding of instruction and information prior to
    direct experience with grappling with a difficult problem with trial and error
    repetition. The goal of the research is to illustrate that math simulations show
    the highest achievement in comparison to other methodologies and that Productive
    Failure is a viable tenant of learning that can be applied to all fields supporting
    higher math applications and scientific discovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in development of Ultrasonic Nanocoining - a new platform technology that is used to generate plastic films or glass panels that are anti-reflective, self-cleaning, or colored through structure. Such nano-structured surfaces can provide benefits for a wide array of commercial applications, ranging from consumer electronics to automotive and aerospace. These surfaces can save energy by preventing internal reflections in OLED displays and cover-glass reflections on the surface of solar panels. What?s more, these surfaces enable better use of available space by adding functionality to surfaces without adding any appreciable volume. Nanocoining is a low-temperature, chemical-free process that does not rely on chemical etching or nano-particles, which have recently come under scrutiny from the EPA because of unknown health and environment effects. The science contained within the project spans several disciplines, and Nanocoining would ultimately contribute to low-cost, scalable manufacturing for a wide array of industries.


    Ultrasonic Nanocoining enables low-cost, high volume reproduction of surface textures comprised of nano-structures that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This is done by creating a cylindrical mold with a nano-structured surface, then imprinting that mold into plastics using roll-to-roll processing. The objectives of the current project are to use Nanocoining to indent billions of sub-wavelength features into both flat and cylindrical Nickel-plated molds in a continuous pattern, then use these molds to replicate the structure into a variety of polymer materials using roll-to-roll processing. The research will study each step of the mold fabrication process, including focused ion beam machining of the diamond die, controlling a dual-mode ultrasonic resonant actuator and registering millions of indents side-by-side without leaving a significant seam between them. Replicated film surfaces will be tested for optical and wetting properties, and the final result will be functionalized transparent film samples that prove commercial potential. In the future the process may be used to create meter-scale nano-structured metal molds for production-scale imprinting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to revolutionize the efficiency of electric motors in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) market. The innovation technology area is a new class of electric motor and control hardware and software that is based on switched reluctance technology, exhibiting very high efficiencies of 90%+ across a broad range of speeds. This innovation will enhance scientific understanding by showing how this new class of electric motors can be optimized to minimize noise and vibration, while allowing variable speed control and Internet connectivity. The potential societal impacts of such a technology are significant: more than half the new motors purchased each year in the United States are 1-5 horsepower motors (1.024M of 1.792M), and they collectively account for nearly 25% of the United States electricity consumption. As such, if commercialized this technology could save retail and commercial organizations millions of dollars a year in electricity savings due to efficiency improvements. The benefits for an adoption rate of just 5% of available applications are $500M / year in electricity savings and 1M tons / year of carbon savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to research a new type of electric motor with a high rotor pole switched reluctance (HRSRM) design. This HRSRM motor has a simplified physical construction with no permanent magnets but complex electronics that manage the torque and speed in the motor through carefully timed generation of magnetic fields. This class of motors have proven extremely difficult to research because of highly nonlinear response characteristics, and sensitivity to very small changes in timing, electromagnetics, and physical setup. This project will research methods for adapting dynamic control algorithms to increase the speed and sensitivity of the power electronics to manage these characteristics. Research will also examine physical elements of the design and build a generalized simulation model combining both finite element analysis as well as structural modeling, constrained mode analysis and vibration models to reduce and optimize noise, vibration and harshness measures. Finally this project will optimize the ~600 key parameters associated with an HRSRM motor, allowing the rapid design and prototyping of new motor designs in minutes rather than months.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, intraoperative imaging
    technology to address the problem of inadvertent cuts to vasculature during minimally
    invasive surgeries. More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient
    surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured,
    there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood,
    and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to
    corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular
    injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's
    ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical
    need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology
    helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will
    be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for
    multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent
    imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins,
    ureters and bile ducts) in real-time for improved surgical guidance and outcomes.
    \n\nThe proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization
    platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
    The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about
    vessel presence and size in real-time that can supplement a surgeon's technique.
    This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate.
    Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery
    is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed
    technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels
    to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time,
    supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value
    to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image
    analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss
    due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology
    will be validated ex vivo and in vivo using a porcine animal model."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the objective of demonstrating that discrete, belt mounted internet-connected wearable devices used by industrial workers can detect high risk lifting activities, promote safe lifting practices and behavior change, and predict the risk of musculoskeletal injuries due to unsafe lifting. Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.

    The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable
    continuous sensing applications in a wide range of energy-constrained sensor-enabled
    devices. Without dramatic innovations in the development of ultralow power sensory
    processing, continuous and accurate sensing will remain a niche application limited
    to environments with a stable and plentiful power source and significant computing
    resources. The technology described in this proposal will demonstrate the viability
    and potential widespread deployment of continuous sensing devices in mobile or
    remote environments with strict energy constraints. An important immediate market
    for the proposed technology with significant customer base is the smartphone and
    wearables market, where many new and emerging end user applications could leverage
    environmental sensing to trigger context-based and anticipatory actions. The proposed
    technology is broadly applicable to a number of other markets and domains, including
    medical, health, and safety monitoring of critical patient sensors, personal fitness
    devices, military applications, and environmental monitors. The ability to flexibly
    deploy continuous sensing for these and other applications has the potential to
    revolutionize these markets and create entirely new and unforeseen application
    domains. \n\t\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 Project plans to
    research and develop algorithms based on the properties of biological spiking
    neurons and the sensory processing capabilities of the human brain. The human
    brain is truly unique in its ability to use a basic computational element, the
    spiking neuron, and perform a broad variety of tasks. The brain has the ability
    to accurately classify sensory patterns from multiple modalities (touch, sight,
    etc.), to interpret the outside world, and to recognize the current context. A
    key intellectual merit of this project is a demonstration of how these novel neural
    algorithms can perform accurate, robust, and low power sensory analysis across
    multiple sensory domains. Just as the brain is capable of processing data from
    very different sensors. Researching and developing these neural algorithms will
    provide insight as to how the human brain learns to recognize important sensory
    information, how it is able to integrate information from such different sense
    modalities, and how it is able to perform complex analysis so efficiently."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the effort to bring our biomimetic rotor
    design to the marine hydrokinetic (MHK) market. MHK energy is a socially and environmentally
    friendly alternative to hydroelectric power, which harnesses energy from rivers,
    tides, ocean currents and manmade waterways without the use of a dam. This market
    is potentially large but still nascent due to high technology costs, concerns
    over turbine survivability, fish friendliness, and difficulty in permitting deployments.
    Our rotor's small, flexible configuration is a unique approach that addresses
    many MHK challenges with the mission of reaching the largest set of individuals
    underserved by current energy technologies. Our rotor seeks to displace diesel
    generation and complement intermittent renewable energy sources by providing an
    affordable, baseload clean energy solution for any individual or community; with
    the objective of scaling up to larger deployments by leveraging the scalable rotor
    design. This R&D Project will expand the body of knowledge for the rapidly emerging
    field of biomimicry by developing a flexible micro-hydro solution that enables
    energy generation from flowing water by allowing fluids to move over the surfaces
    of the rotor in their naturally preferred way. \n\n\n\nThis project will transform
    our promising proprietary rotor design into an optimized MHK turbine to be incorporated
    as the key component of a flexible micro-hydro system that addresses many of the
    challenges faced by the MHK market. The rotor is based on biomimicry and was designed
    using streamlines found in moving bodies of water with a deep profile to maximize
    the power transfer from low speed flows. The logarithmic design with receding
    edges results in a turbine that avoids damaging impacts with debris and marine
    life. The design is stable in variable flow conditions, which allows for a flexible
    power takeoff configuration with both the generator and power electronics housed
    above the water for improved affordability. During the project, computational
    fluid dynamic modeling will be used to simulate design changes and drive performance
    improvements. The most promising designs will be prototyped and integrated with
    multiple generator and tether combinations to determine the most efficient flexible
    power takeoff system. Conversion to power output for 12V battery charging will
    also be tested and optimized resulting in a complete power conversion chain. The
    performance of the rotor and system will be characterized by full scale testing
    locally and with The University of Washington."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its ability to improve healthcare in fundamental ways, such as (1) low volume draws that will enable diagnostics in low-resource settings like drug stores, at home, or in developing countries, (2) higher quality small-volume samples to make Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics more competitive with lab tests, enabling faster results in critical care/outpatient environments, and (3) low draw volumes, coupled with small volume diagnostic tests, that will enable improved care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired anemia, including neonates and patients with bone marrow damage caused by cancers or suppressed bone marrow due to cancer drugs. Our technology will enable medical testing from a small amount of blood, which could significantly impact global neonatal and pediatric healthcare, particularly in developing countries, and expand the market for blood containers.


    This project aims to design a microliter-scale blood container that offers the same analytic stability and consistency as blood samples obtained by larger volume tubes.  Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen.  In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent.  In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing.  Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing.  This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization.  We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws.  This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures.  We will test a number of ASAP configurations in order to minimize the time required for specimen stabilization.  The project will culminate with the production of a fully functional prototype that will be validated via comparison against blood stabilized in a larger volume specimen tube.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses
    on developing compact camera modules with lower noise and improved contrast using
    a submicron pixel imaging sensor array. The commercial potential of this project
    centers on developing compact cameras for endoscopes, navigational and robotic
    surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even
    the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of
    medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally
    invasive forms of some common surgeries could save an estimated $14 billion in
    healthcare spending. Oncology, urology, gastroenterology, women's health and pediatric
    medicine are just some of the specialties that will significantly benefit from
    these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing
    submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size
    and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling.
    The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture
    arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor
    imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion
    free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications
    in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics.  \n\nThe miniaturization
    of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain
    point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited,
    yielding low signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops
    a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers.
    As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can
    remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements
    to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark
    contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold
    scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing
    these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based
    devices to silicon.  The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication,
    and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the
    system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array
    for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images
    to characterize the noise, contrast and other image quality parameters of the
    prototype."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing manufactured concrete blocks that can be used to build arches, including roofs.  This feature has never been done with manufactured concrete block, and holds the potential to greatly expand the uses, benefits and capabilities of concrete block to an entirely new market segment.  The structures expected to be made possible with this novel masonry system include inexpensive, high-performance, energy efficient buildings with increased fire safety ratings, resistance to termites, increased safety for tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis and other sever weather events, and greatly increased building life cycle time. This technology could have a large positive economic impact on masonry construction and on the concrete block manufacturing industry in particular, both across the US and around the globe.  This work is expected to provide a greater understanding of the anisotropic strength of manufactured concrete block, and how this anisotropic strength is to be maximized within a given structure; this scientific understanding is expected to benefit the catenary thrust-line analysis of masonry arches.  This technology is expected to make superior construction available to homeowners, businesses, government buildings and public works (including bridges) at greatly reduced cost.


    This project will create a design for a building which will utilize as many of the common features made available by this masonry system which the average user (homeowner, building owner, business, government agency, etc.) is expected to want to use.  This building will be designed as a planetarium for Alfred University's Stull Observatory, and will include a twenty-four foot diameter planetarium room, as a domed hemisphere, made as a third frequency truncated icosahedron.  This building will also include a separate meeting room and a separate office.  This building will include Gothic windows, arched roofs, and flying buttresses which will create an outdoor porch which rings the outside of this building.  This building will be designed with a Professional Engineer and a Registered Design Professional (architect) to show all the equations, stress analyses, free body diagrams, etc., which were used to arrive at the final design.  Once completed, this building will serve as a test or sample building used to obtain an Evaluation Report by the International Code Council - Evaluation Services (ICC-ES).  A positive Evaluation Report from ICC-ES will allow this technology to be sold globally in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality of care for anterior ocular wounds. To accomplish this, the project is focused on the development of a novel, hand-held, point-of-care device that can be used to evaluate the ocular surface in post-trauma or post-surgical patients. The device should be able to provide an accurate, objective measurement of a tear film biomarker that can be used by medical professionals to identify dangerous fluid leaks in the front of the eye which can save vision. Currently, this evaluation is only performed by trained eye doctors and requires positioning the patient at an expensive, immobile machine called a slit lamp to evaluate their eye. This cannot be done on patients who are unconscious or uncooperative and availability of this machine is limited. The lack of adequate tools for evaluation results in limited access to care, costly hospital transfers and missed diagnosis of wound leaks which can cause severe ocular infections and permanent vision loss. Successful commercialization of this product is expected to improve the accuracy of ocular examinations in 3.8 million Americans annually and may introduce a new frontier of tear film testing.


    The proposed project is focused on developing the device for direct use for patient care. The technological aim of the research is on the creation of a sophisticated biosensor that can accurately and noninvasively evaluate the tear film concentration of a specific biomarker. This work is expected to include the development of the electrical circuitry, the chemical composition and the channels for connection to the base unit. The plan is to also design the model for the handheld device. In order to make the device safe for patient use, the device can then be tested for its shelf-life stability and develop the proper sterilization. The next steps of testing can include clinical patients to evaluate the ability of the device to record the findings from the tear film. This information can then be used to refine the exact testing parameters for the device. The anticipated result of this research is a final prototype of the device that can be used for regulatory approval and clinical trials. The goal of the project is to transform the current standard of care for eye professionals and enable physicians to have an objective measure that can warn them about possible wound leaks and potentially save vision.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project include 1) the targeted problem (power system state estimator) is extremely critical in modern power grids or smart grids which may help prevent system-wide failures or blackouts if properly handled, 2) the certainty of commercialization of the proposed approach warranting significant NSF support because the provided solution is fast enough for real-time application and the new state estimator does not ask for additional inputs or requirements compared with existing solutions, 3) the research team is formed by technical as well as marketing personnel which ensures the success of the sales of the products, 4) the uniqueness of the proposed approach which provides competitive benefits to the market that cannot be met by alternate technologies and can attract further funding from non-SBIR sources and result in direct sales to power industry, 5) the proposed approach develops a unique formulation/solution of state estimation which very possibly leads to further innovations, 6) the new procedure of the proposed approach based on unique formulation and unique philosophy can promote teaching, training and learning in the area of state estimation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project contains intellectual merit that lies in 1) achieving a fast and robust solution to a 40-years' open problem of robustness in power system state estimation, which is a critical and challenging problem, 2) developing a unique formulation of state estimation which easily prevents robust problems suffered by the existing approaches to state estimation and which provides advanced knowledge and understanding in the area of state estimation, 3) a well-qualified team led by the PI who has research experience in state estimation for more than 15 years and has published actively and widely in state estimation and other related areas, 4) the high originality of the proposed solution which is developed based on a completely different philosophy than the existing ones, and is innovative even in the theory of statistics, 5) reflecting state-of-the-art in the area of power system state estimation ? presently a major research activity, and 6) easy integration of synchronized phasor measurements into the proposed state estimator.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to overcome limitations that prevent effective treatment of wound infections. There is a large potential market for this product as the U.S. spends over $50 billion per year on wound care and current wound care products have a high risk of rejection, scarring, and antibiotic resistance. The proposed novel wound care product will reduce the costs to treat infected wounds and limit the number of medical procedures required to restore tissue function. The product consists of a patented human extracellular matrix (hECM) coupled to a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The main innovation of the proposed product, compared to current treatments, is that it is designed to be toxic to infective bacteria and other pathogens, without harming human tissue. The hECM has regenerative and anti-inflammatory activity to enhance wound healing and improve treatment outcomes. In addition to creating a transformative product in a global market, achievement of AMP extracellular matrix tethering will lead to a broader understanding of AMP activity and unlock their commercial utility. The product can be used as a temporary wound dressing, a tissue restoring implant, or an implant coating.


    The proposed project will utilize a patented recombinant protein with an antimicrobial peptide, combined with a human extracellular matrix (hECM) material. The patented antimicrobial protein (AMP) is designed to bind collagen in the hECM. The combination of hECM and AMP will result in an antimicrobial regenerative matrix that will reduce the incidence of infection and improve wound healing. The objectives of the project are to scale-up hECM and AMP manufacturing processes, establish methods for assessing product characteristics and performance for manufacturing quality assurance and release criteria, and evaluate the shelf-life and in vivo performance of the scaled-up manufactured AMP-hECM product in a clinically relevant infectious wound healing model.  The AMP-hECM will be evaluated using biochemical, antimicrobial, mechanical and cell growth performance assays.  Scale-up of the bioengineered AMP and hECM will be achieved by optimizing the in vitro manufacturing bioreactor growth parameters and processing methods to improve overall product yield.  The anticipated outcome of the project is to have defined the large-scale manufacturing protocols and release criteria for the AMP-hECM product. This milestone will enable the execution of validation production runs, and advance the regulatory and commercialization pathways for the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the improvement of atmospheric state observations from various platforms. This compact, integrated and ?plug and play? receiver design will make the existing observations more available, more economical, and will also enable previously unattainable observations of water vapor distributions within the atmosphere. This environmental sensor?s small size and low power requirements enables its deployment on various airborne, spaceborne or ground-based platforms, such as unmanned aerial aircraft, nanosatellites, ocean buoys, and remotely located ground-based instruments. One promising commercial application is private weather observing satellite constellations. It has been estimated that around 400 remote sensing nano/microsatellites will be launched worldwide between the years of 2016-2018. Water vapor and cloud observations are among the most important observations promising further understanding of weather events and to better synoptic or mesoscale forecasts. Improved atmospheric observations are directly related to increasingly accurate and useful weather forecasts. The benefits are expected to extend widely across the economy. Meteorologists point to more accurate and rapidly refreshed atmospheric observations as one of the necessities for the continuous improvements in weather forecasting, understanding of the atmospheric physics and climate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will complete the design and build a fully functional prototype of a very compact, direct detection radiometer receiver, operating in the vicinity of the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line. All the receiver components will be designed and evaluated, including a noise source, detectors, filters, Monolithic Microwave Integrated circuits and others, first as individual parts and then within the assembly. A novel receiver architecture and integration of all components into one assembly allow for a drastic reduction in the receiver size and reduction of its power consumption, while improving its observational capabilities and stability. There are several aspects of the proposed effort that are unique and would provide profound advances in ultra-compact microwave radiometry. The receiver is expected to consume less than 0.5 Watt of power and weigh around 100 grams, with a continuous two-point calibration capability at its input.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating.   If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals.  The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually.  The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment.  The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies.  The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs.  By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas.  For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species.

    The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge.  The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings.  The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings.  Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths.  To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II Project will systematically develop, test, and
    revise a video game. Emerging technologies, such as educational videogames, have
    the potential to increase the accessibility of learning materials, promote readiness
    and knowledge of employment options, and improve students' attitudes toward full-time
    employment. Unfortunately, the lack of an accessible, coherent career planning
    system in the United States has left many high school students unprepared to meet
    the rigorous demands associated with being college and career ready. This project
    will teach critical life, social, and academic skills related to a career in Science,
    Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This project is designed to enhance
    student learning, reduce school costs, and increase the efficacy of transition
    plans, which are mandated for every student with a disability under Federal law.
    The game aligns with Common Core Standards and the Universal Design for Learning
    framework. While this project will be designed for students with disabilities,
    it is assumed the highly accessible career preparation software will also meet
    a critical need for other students at risk of learning failure or students without
    disabilities. \n\nThis project is a critical component of a comprehensive product
    line that will provide adolescents with virtual career training. During the project,
    participants will experience mini-games related to their daily living skills,
    a \"day in the life\" of a person in a STEM career, and social skills that those
    allow individuals to interpret different cultures in a STEM environment. A virtual
    mentor coaches the student to make choices that will lead to career advancement
    and explains the hierarchy of jobs within the chosen career. The virtual mentor
    also provides financial advice throughout the daily living games, modeling exemplary
    fiscal management and reinforcing decisions that have a high likelihood of leading
    to financial stability. The project team will build, test, analyze, and revise
    the mini-games and then compile the revisions into a beta version of the game.
    Initial friends and family tests of the alpha builds will include qualitative
    evaluation using observations and interviews. This will be followed with beta
    testing in public schools using a mixed methods design. Beta testing will include
    students with and without disabilities in grades six through nine, special education
    and general education teachers, counselors and parents."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a hormone-free treatment alternative for women suffering from vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the vaginal tissue is thin, dry, and inelastic. Women with vaginal atrophy experience day-to-day vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This SBIR project catalyzes the development of a technology platform that will enable a novel home-use, hormone-free medical device to treat vaginal atrophy. This project represents a medical device treatment for vaginal atrophy developed specifically for women wishing to avoid hormone-based therapies. Currently available treatment options fall in two categories: over-the-counter products and hormone-replacement therapies. Over-the-counter products, like lubricants, are available at drugstores, but these products are often limited in their efficacy relative to the severity of symptoms many women experience. Hormone-replacement therapies on the other hand, such as estrogen creams, can be effective for women; however they are contraindicated for large market segments of women (e.g. breast cancer survivors and women with cardiovascular risk factors). Therefore, this SBIR project is critical to the development of a safe treatment alternative for women and represents a chance to significantly improve their quality of life.

    The proposed project supports the technical work required to develop this medical device treatment and addresses a major unmet need for breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women. The work supported by this SBIR grant will complete necessary device improvements and prepare the technology platform for commercialization. The main objectives of this project are to 1) optimize the device for safety and usability, 2) execute specific design enhancements to ensure cost-effective manufacturability, and 3) complete all necessary quality system testing to meet FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requirements. To achieve the first objective, the company will complete all prescribed activities under the company's quality management system. User interviews will also be completed with device prototypes to explore features that enable and encourage appropriate device use. This work will be completed in cooperation between the company's engineering team and an outside industrial design firm. The second objective will require design for manufacturing activities, which will also be completed in a partnership with an outside firm. The third objective will be executed again by following the company's quality management system policies, processes, and procedures. All of these activities, once complete, will ensure the company's device is ready for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.

    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to a wide range of electronics in the areas of communications, Internet, portable electronics, and power electronics. Although magnetic based transformers have been the industry standard for over a century they have many negatives including miniaturization difficulties, electromagnetic interference issues, and issues with larger voltage step-up applications. The main goal of the research is to develop a ceramic replacement for magnetic transformers that is both conducive to miniaturization, provides higher power densities, provides a large increase in safe operating temperatures, and that is cost competitive with standard magnetic devices. This technology will provide important advantages for many applications; the ability to produce at low cost also opens up large new markets that are not easily reached using conventional magnetics.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to develop new low temperature sintering processes and transformer structures that enable the use of base metal electrodes to replace very expensive platinum. This drastically reduces costs of ceramic transformers and substantially improves performance due to the fact that a poor electrical/thermal conductor, Platinum, is now replaced with base metal (Copper) that is a high performance electrical/thermal conductor. This translates into both higher power throughput in devices that are lighter weight and lower profile and also a new ability to now match the high temperature range of wide bandgap power devices. The success of this program immediately leads to a revolutionary next step of being able to insert power management/conversion electronics directly within integrated circuits such as in application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research, Phase II project is to help make therapy more consistent with patient preferences, beliefs, and values to maximize engagement in therapy and improve patient outcomes. Therapy for mental health problems is highly effective, yet many patients drop out before getting the full benefit because they are not satisfied or engaged in the therapy. The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients actions in the online treatment system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced. This is the intelligent counseling system. It will work very similarly to movie streaming services or online book sellers who recommend movies or books to you based on your past preferences and the preferences of thousands of other users.

    The proposed project will develop a feedback and recommendation system based on advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to provide personalized treatments to customize and individualize online mental health treatment, the Intelligent Counseling System (ICS). This personalized system will contain a number of alternative treatment items from several theoretical perspectives, using a variety of patient interactive activities, varying in format, length, pace, and other characteristics. In such a setting, a recommendation system can predict the users' preferences and recommend the subsequent treatment component. In addition, to achieve maximum adherence and to decrease the attrition rate, the platform will enable personalized motivational interventions and supportive messaging. The delivery times and the content of supportive messaging will adapt and vary depending on the projected treatment progress. Our machine learning based system will be trained incrementally as more data becomes available over time, thus it will benefit from improved accuracy over time. We will extract local, semi-local, and global temporal features at multiple temporal resolutions and will use feature selection techniques to identify which factors contribute to the success of treatments for patients, and to predict if a user is improving or is deteriorating. This will result in adaptive motivational messages and recommendation for tailoring treatment in term of important identified treatment features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a portable, low cost blood typing and anemia screening device for use in blood donation centers, hospitals, humanitarian efforts and the military.   This helps society because every two seconds in United States someone needs blood, yet less than 4% of Americans donate blood.  Unfortunately, 15-20% of blood collected is wasted due to over collection of unneeded blood types and related blood type logistics.  12 million units of blood are collected annually in US with 108 million units worldwide.   U.S. blood centers are under significant economic pressures to reduce per unit blood costs and thus waste reduction tools and strategies are in demand.  Blood unit costs approach $200 per pint of blood, so this device provides the ability to pre-screen donors by blood type and selectively direct the donation process (i.e. plasma, red cells) to reduce blood product waste and better match supply with hospital demand.   This portable technology could also be translated to remote geographical locations for disaster relief applications. The potential economic savings has the potential to be $400M and will contribute to reducing the overall cost of U.S. health care.

    The proposed project will advance knowledge across multiple fields.  It adapts knowledge in microfluidics and the use of electric fields to characterize cells to identify the molecular expression on blood cells responsible for ABO-Rh blood type.  This project advances the use of electric fields to rapidly measure cell concentration.  This project develops software for real time tracking of cell population motion, which is highly valuable in many cell microscopy applications.  This project also adapts advanced pattern recognition tools like machine learning to extract even more information from the cell behaviors. This work also extends statistical analysis from static population means to analysis of functional data - a field in its infancy - via a critical application.   Finally, the device and electronics engineering will advance under the principle that "simple is best", leading to fewer potential failure points and less costly manufacture. This work advances scientific knowledge and will be published and widely disseminated after securing additional IP. It is also a powerful alternative to expensive antigen/antibody molecular recognition reactions (i.e. traditional blood typing) for medical screening and diagnosis for future point of care diagnostic applications.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project intends
    to meet the need for low cost dose-on-demand production of Carbon-11 isotope for
    biomarker and radiotracer applications in nuclear medicine.  Biomarkers and radiotracers
    are commonly used for Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT)
    metabolic imaging, in support of research, drug discovery, and detection of cancer
    and other illnesses.  They are also used for therapy staging of cancer, to determine
    if treatment is effective.  Common examples include myocardial perfusion imaging
    of the heart to visualize blood flow and function, PET scanning of the brain to
    detect early onset Alzheimer's and brain tumors, and Choline PET/CT for the diagnosis
    and staging of prostate cancer. Carbon-11 is an important radiotracer/radiopharmaceutical
    that offers unique advantages due to its ability to be easily incorporated into
    many molecules without impacting biological activity.  Carbon-11 is currently
    produced by using specialized targets on high-energy commercial cyclotrons.  These
    cyclotrons cost millions of dollars to install, and existing targets are inefficient.
    \ Low energy cyclotrons are significantly less expensive, and are currently under
    development by multiple commercial companies.  This project seeks to develop a
    novel cyclotron target methodology for producing Carbon-11 at low energies using
    unique nanomaterials, resulting in significantly lower costs.  \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is in the use of novel nanomaterials to produce Carbon-11
    more efficiently and at lower cost, through development of recoil escape targets.
    \ It is challenging to find a good target material suitable for both efficient
    production of Carbon-11, by one of several available nuclear reactions, and efficient
    recovery of the produced radiotracer in a usable form.  The produced Carbon-11
    can be difficult to recover, as it is easily trapped in many conventional target
    materials, resulting in low yields.  Recent advances in nanoscience and technology
    allow for production of novel materials with unique characteristics.  Boron nitride
    nanotubes (BNNT) are composed of fibers with single atomic thickness, or at most
    a few atoms thick, allowing Carbon-11 to be efficiently produced and recovered
    in the form of carbon dioxide gas using low energy cyclotrons.  Prototype production
    targets will be developed and tested at commercial cyclotron sites.  The process
    for collecting the produced Carbon-11 gas will be optimized to achieve the highest
    yields of usable radiotracer material.  Efforts will be made to further develop
    BNNT materials with ideal characteristics, including high purity and optimal density."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the reduction in severe patient morbidity and elimination of hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditures by the U.S. healthcare system each year on revision surgeries and unnecessary procedures associated with late detection of post-surgical blood clots. Surgeons have the ability to prevent these catastrophic events, but only if the onset of the clot can be detected in a timely manner. Currently, of the patients who form clots after the targeted surgeries, half will suffer from a surgical failure due to the shortcomings of current modalities. This technology gives clinicians the ability to non-invasively track changes in blood flow within critical vessels to enable intervention prior to any compromise in health and prevent a majority of these catastrophic incidents. Beyond significant decreases in patient suffering and morbidity, such interventions will have an enormous positive economic impact on the health care system. This technology can also substantially improve clinical understanding of the clotting process and possibly enable non-invasive therapeutic treatments for these patients who otherwise would receive surgery.

    The proposed project offers significant intellectual and scientific merit associated with new methods of ultrasound flow analysis. The objective of this work is to develop a system that is able to collect a 3D volume of ultrasound data and automatically extract the blood flow data in the region of interest by detecting an implantable component. This novel approach to measuring vascular flow will be the first to enable detection of localized post-operative clot formation rather than detecting clot-related issues via delayed and indirect methods that leave patients at risk for surgical failures. This technique can allow for intervention earlier than all other available methods, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs. Furthermore, this method enables automatic detection of critical changes in blood flow, eliminating the risk of human error. Lastly, dissemination of the technology developed in this proposal represents an important milestone towards the creation of simpler, more automated ultrasound systems that can place this non-invasive, non-ionizing modality in the hands of non-expert clinicians for use in a broader spectrum of medical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

    The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.

    The telecommunication market sector has been increasingly consolidating to Asia
    and Europe where foreign governments are making strategic investments to encourage
    work in their respective countries. In a long-term, the proposed interference
    elimination technology can lead to increased investment in the telecom equipment

    and reduced requirements for many components such as antenna and filters. This
    in turn will reduce the overall cost per data link, as well as reducing the size,
    weight, and power requirements of the system. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the critical need for disruptive RF
    interference mitigation solutions. As networks are moving toward higher performance
    to accommodate larger capacity than ever seen before, the network operators, industry

    for next generation 5G wireless networks.  There are two advantages offered by
    the proposed interference elimination technology. One advantage is extreme wide
    instantaneous bandwidth and the other is flexible tunability over GHz of operating
    frequency.  These advantages help to consolidate and reduce front-end hardware.
    The focus of this program will be first on developing an optical system-on-chip
    version of the interference cancellation system with monolithically photonic integrated
    circuits. With a complete and fully function development board, the second focus

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.

- abstractText: "This Phase II project impacts the way engineering design is taught
    in design courses and contributes to the training of a strong workforce in areas
    related to science, technology and engineering. The Ecosystem is a software tool
    that automatically verifies designs against the requirements, to uncover oversights
    early in the process, but also fosters engineering judgement and creativity, allows
    for assessment of designs with less subjectivity, and facilitates smooth communication
    among team members. This results in productivity enhancements, higher quality
    designs and shorter time-to-market, but also in societal benefits (safer products,
    less risk of catastrophic accidents and more competitive design organizations).
    The target market consists of (1) educational institutions teaching engineering
    design, and (2) design companies striving to ensure compliance with the design
    specifications.  The core innovation is three-fold.  First, it consists of an
    e-design assessment engine that is being developed to a high degree of sophistication.
    \ Second, design repositories are investigated and developed for integration.
    \ Third, holistic (big data) analysis of design content and metadata is implemented.
    \n\nThe project seeks to develop an innovative design decision (learning) support
    system addressing problems related to the high cost of design oversights. Such
    oversights can result in catastrophic failures, product recalls, or simply in
    budget or schedule over-runs (due to rework).  The Ecosystem offers a flexible,
    yet systematic and generic, framework, for guiding designers through the design
    process, and for automatically assessing design activities, from each stage in
    the design process, against the product design specification (PDS). At the center
    of the Ecosystem is the e-design assessment engine, which decomposes the PDS,
    correlates the design activities against individual requirements, and provides
    real-time advisories in case of design oversights. The assessment engine automatically
    configures popular development tools for engineering design, determines relevant
    analyses, and interprets the outputs. The Ecosystem interfaces with these development
    tools, but does not replace. The Ecosystem can translate qualitative customer
    requirements into solid engineering requirements, and verify the relevance of
    the design content provided through seamless interfaces with industry databases.
    The Ecosystem improves designers' productivity through automation of many administrative
    tasks (e.g., generation of project reports). Despite the automation, the learning
    experience is not diminished. The Ecosystem prompts for, captures, and preserves
    the rationale for relevant engineering decisions. It also supports accredited,
    generic learning objectives for engineering design."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide wireless technology for economic high-speed internet connectivity in under-served rural regions, addressing the needs of 40 million Americans and over 50% of the global population. The technological developments in this project will pave the way for adoption of Massive, or Many-Antenna MIMO technologies in next-generation wireless systems by addressing scalability bottlenecks with innovative hardware and protocol design. The result of this project will be a revolutionary new wireless system for internet service providers addressing an $80 billion fixed wireless systems market and connecting under-served global communities to high-speed internet commerce, communications, education, and entertainment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop a production-ready Television White Space (TVWS) Massive MU-MIMO wireless system for IP data traffic, then use it to characterize for the first time diverse, large-scale multi-user TVWS channels. This project will demonstrate the first economically-viable Massive MIMO system, as well as the first point-to-multipoint wireless system capable of non-line-of-sight ranges over 10s of miles with over 2 Gbps of aggregate capacity. The system will be used to measure and characterize TVWS channels at scale in various rural environments, with large beamforming arrays serving tens of clients tens of miles away. In particular, these measurements will explore the effect of range, environment, user separation, and polarization on real-world achievable capacity. The results will be used to guide the design, optimization, and deployment of rural TVWS broadband networks across the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its ability to implement multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) detectors of any size. This, in turn, impacts the broad needs of wireless
    communications industry that is always in search of more efficient use of the scarce spectral resources.
    Since its invention 15 years ago, MIMO has been included in all wireless standards, e.g. WiFi,
    WiMAX, and LTE. As of today, MIMO products of sizes up to 4x4 (i.e. 4 transmit and 4 receive
    antennas) have appeared in the market, while the most recent standards, such as IEEE 802.11ac WiFi
    and LTE-Advanced cellular, have specified MIMO sizes as large as 8x8. For WiFi this can mean more
    effective hot-spots in public and workplace settings. For cellular this can mean improved connectivity
    in rural areas with fewer base-station towers, having a positive economic impact. Industry activities
    that attempt to build larger MIMO systems such as 16x16 are occurring. Massive MIMO networks with
    more than 100 antennas at the base stations have recently been proposed for 5G cellular and beyond.
    These trends indicate a large market opportunity for the scalable MIMO technology that this project
    builds upon.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project plans to develop and
    commercialize a set of intellectual property (IP) software-codes/IP-cores related to multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) communications. These cores address the needs of wireless chipset
    manufacturers. The main hurdle in the design and implementation of MIMO systems is their
    complexity which drives cost and power consumption. The complexity of an optimal MIMO detector
    grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The same is true for most of the near
    optimal MIMO detectors that have been suggested in the literature and adopted by industry. This
    limitation has been the main impediment in developing commercial MIMO systems that support larger
    array sizes with increased range and data rate. This project adopts a novel technology that achieves near
    optimal performance having complexity that only grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas.
    It thus can be used to implement MIMO systems of any size, at an affordable complexity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

    The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.

    This Phase II project is to the first personalized learning platform for hands-on education that works with the billions of mobile devices already in people's hands worldwide. Because the technology works on any mobile device and requires little instructor facilitation, it will be commercially successful in home settings when parents are busy and school settings where budget restrictions limit the number of facilitators. Beyond commercial impact, this project will help address the nation's need to prepare citizens for the 21st century economy, improve science literacy and help provide equal opportunities to underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This project is an effective teaching tool because it employs personalized learning, where the content and pace of learning are optimized for the individual learner. Personalized learning has already been shown to result in higher learner engagement and increased retention of concepts in educational software. Through the use of proprietary augmented reality and adaptive learning technology, this project brings personalized learning to hands-on STEM education, enabling learners to develop problem solving skills in a more effective, engaging and lower cost way.

    The key innovation in this project is a single software framework combining advanced augmented reality  (AR) and adaptive learning (AL) techniques to capture learners? interactions with real world objects (for example, circuit blocks, fraction bricks or chemistry models) via a mobile device camera, analyze the significance of the interactions and automatically provide personalized guidance to each learner.  The system will be the first to provide a high level API above the complexity of AR and AL, allowing designers of learning experience modules to focus solely on content and user experience instead of hundreds of thousands of lines of complex code associated with AR and AL. The methods employed will be the research, design and development of the augmented reality and adaptive learning engine, its integration with three learning experience modules: circuits, fractions, basic geometry, and an evaluation of the modules. To guide the development, pilot studies utilizing A/B testing with competing approaches, pre and post assessments, and behavioral analysis of users interacting with the system will be conducted periodically.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is improvement in cost-efficiency, energy-efficiency, and quality in manufacturing automation, increasing worker productivity and reducing repetitive motion injuries. This integrated visual-tactile system will be 3-4 times more inexpensive ($20,000 purchase cost vs. existing $65,000-80,000 vision system), improve the speed and accuracy of current robotic handling systems, and facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks. By enabling new robotic applications and increasing productivity in current automation, this solution will help the U.S. maintain a competitive domestic manufacturing sector.  In 2009 there were 36,190 logged repetitive motion injuries in the U.S.; the median missed work time from these injuries was 21 days (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).  This innovative solution will facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks and greatly improve the speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of current robotic handling systems.  The immediate commercial applications are in industrial robotics, specifically robotics in agile manufacturing. In the long term, the technology will be applied in personal, healthcare, and military robots. The current market potential for tactile sensors for industrial robots is estimated as $576 million - $1.15 billion and expected to more than double by 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will result in a combined visual-tactile system that will give robots an integrated sense of touch and vision, much like the hand-eye coordination of humans. It incorporates a technically novel compliant tactile sensing solution?a rubber ?skin? that can be molded into any form factor and is inexpensive and durable.  This advanced skin technology can resolve object shape, contact/slip events, and forces of contacted objects.  It will uniquely fuse visual and tactile information for object handling and pose estimation resulting in flexible robotic system that handles objects more like humans do.  This approach addresses key weaknesses in vision-based robotic manufacturing, such as occlusion and dislodging when parts are grasped.  Current industrial robots are restricted in their ability to handle small, irregularly shaped, soft, or fragile parts. Existing solutions rely on expensive and complex 3D-vision systems or repetitive manual labor. This solution is two-fold: (1) A new flexible tactile sensor that can be tailored to a wide variety of form factors; (2) Software to fuse the tactile data with a vision system to estimate pose of objects in pick-and-place tasks.

    the advancement of telerobotic control technology for subsea operations. As humans
    deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific
    sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote
    locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs
    have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical
    machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing
    and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry
    with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational
    awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create
    high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion
    and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional
    visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated
    robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this
    technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced
    for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs,
    new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the
    national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges
    of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls.
    Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command
    and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and
    the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations
    that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and
    that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in
    the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and
    processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and
    vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control
    methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example
    of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software
    platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability,
    and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible
    for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused
    on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications,
    such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic
    dredging and excavation."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in bringing epoxy based conductive polymer
    anticorrosion paint system to the market. Corrosion will cost the US economy over
    $1 trillion in 2015. It is highly desirable to develop more effective anticorrosion
    technologies to reduce this huge economic cost of corrosion. The most effective
    anticorrosion pigments in use today are based on heavy metal pigments, such as
    chromates, lead compounds, and zinc/zinc compounds. Environmental, health, and
    safety concerns are driving the elimination of heavy metal pigments. The proposed
    new product will not only reduce toxicity introduced by current heavy-metal based
    anti-corrosion pigments, but also provide much improved corrosion protection.
    The project is especially targeting replacement of the epoxy based zinc-rich primer
    coating systems that are widely used on highway, marine, and energy infrastructures.
    Solving the poor processibility of environmentally friendly conductive polymers
    should enable open up a range of new applications beyond anti-corrosion coatings
    such as electrostatic dissipation, electromagnetic interference shielding, static
    resistant fibers, conductive inks, toners, and adhesives, etc. \n\n\nThe intellectual
    merit of the proposed project lies in using advanced knowledge and understanding
    of anticorrosion coatings. It is generally assumed that organic coatings act as
    barriers to water and oxygen at the coating - environment interface. But corrosion
    of metals is an electrochemical reaction process that relates to both cations
    and anions. The present proposal suggests developing an ion barrier anticorrosion
    coating system: conductive polymer nanoparticle pigmented epoxy primer with a
    topcoat. The combination of the primer and topcoat constructs a barrier to both
    anions and cations, that inhibits the electrochemical corrosion reaction, therefore,
    provides efficient corrosion protection to the metal. This system will not use
    heavy metal anticorrosion pigments any more. If present proposed research succeeds,
    it will demonstrate how an ion barrier coating provides corrosion protection to
    a metal substrate, and how to formulate an ion barrier anticorrosion coating,
    and lead to the next generation of anticorrosion coating."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in online retail industry for garments, orthoses
    and prostheses. Each human body is unique, and the fitting approach is often reduced
    to trying on products in-store or in-clinic. While this approach works to some
    level, increasingly more purchases are made online, and a similar trial and error
    method leads to a high return rate for retailers and a significant time burden
    for customers. The fitting system Eclo is developing will dramatically reduce
    the shipping costs for online retailers and increase the convenience for online
    shoppers. Additionally, the virtual fitting technology will help remove the dependency
    of companies on brick-and-mortar stores and to reduce the cost of goods by half
    in some cases. Furthermore, the technology proposed is the key for mass manufacturing
    of custom garment since all geometric properties of the body will be readily using
    smartphones. The databases of body scans could also be used for designing better

    to also scan the outside of shoes. A fitting algorithm will be developed to detect
    important features on feet and shoes to make size recommendations. A custom device
    will be made to measure the material properties of shoes to give online shoppers
    a description of comfort and support levels of shoes. Online shoppers will be
    given a size recommendation and an in-depth fit description with visual graphics."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new tool revealing important information regarding skeletal muscle strength and health. Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All of these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non-intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle-by-muscle basis and specific analysis to address the muscle weakness problem. Due to the current high cost, the initial targeted customers will be elite athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return-to-sport decisions. However, with research and development to bring down the cost, the ultimate goal is to make a broadly used clinical tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have broad societal impact.

    The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image-based modeling and data analysis tools in order to allow high-throughput imaging, rapid and accurate segmentation of muscles and efficient data analysis. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements. The proposed activities in this funding cycle will continue the technical development process to further bring down the cost with improved image segmentation process and provide additional value with advanced data analysis. It will ultimately be a revolutionary tool to improve muscle health.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be accomplished through a proprietary technology
    with its extraordinary capability to enable a large number of high-value, hard-to-formulate

    this technology targets is a large number of high-value whereas poorly water-soluble
    active ingredients that have been challenging the drug and food industry for a
    long time. For example, around 80% of drug candidates identified by modern drug
    discovery technologies are poorly water-soluble. For food, a large number of vitamins,
    nutrients, antioxidants, and natural colors are poorly water-soluble. Overall,
    poorly water-soluble compounds constitute an enormous formulation challenge. To
    address this need, this team has created a platform technology that is highly

    technology, scale up the synthesis of a core material, obtain the data on its
    safety profile, and advance the commercialization activities by providing prototypes
    to potential customers. This project will be conducted through close collaborations
    among the start-up company, a major university, and a number of major pharmaceutical,
    ingredients, food, and personal care companies. The deliverables of this project
    include the specifications of core material, initial safety evaluations, and prototypes

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a computer-based tutoring platform that adapts its teaching strategy to each student by monitoring their brain activity.  Access to individualized instruction by teachers or qualified tutors is limited for a vast number of students, particularly in disadvantaged areas and for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.  Computer-based teaching technology could meet this demand, but currently relies on indirect inferences of a student's state, and therefore lacks some of the key abilities of human teachers to assess a student during a lesson.  This project will address this challenge by enabling the tutoring system to determine how hard students are thinking and their level of focus. This will be accomplished by measuring a student's brain electrical activity using a newly-developed headset designed specifically for school-aged children.  Information derived from brain activity patterns will be used to guide tutorial topic selection, difficulty of the content and the level of interactivity.  This project could lead to a significant advance in education technology by enhancing the adaptability of computer-based tutoring platforms and expanding the depth of information on student performance available to teachers and parents.  Adaptive computer-based education is now a rapidly growing market, and the technology developed in this project aims to provide companies with a unique capability to improve their products and to meet the need for truly scalable individualized tutoring.

    The unique innovation of this project is to create a tutoring platform that closes the loop with the student by adapting its teaching strategy to the student?s cognitive state.  To overcome the limitations of current adaptive tutoring systems, this product will measure the student's cognitive workload and engagement, and use this information to adapt aspects of the instructional strategy such as topic selection, content difficulty and interactivity in a closed-loop fashion.  The goals of this project are to modify current brain-wave measurement systems for use by children and young adults, extend associated computational algorithms and validate them to an industry standard, and evaluate the effect of adding brain-based metrics to student models that are at the core of adaptive technologies.  To meet these objectives, we will perform research and development to advance technologies for brain-activity monitoring, and conduct studies with students in grades 6 through 12 who will be tutored in subjects such as math, biology and history while their brain activity is recorded.  The results will be used to determine the effects of using brain activity data to improve the adaptability of computer-based tutors and expand the depth of information available to educational data analytics platforms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant.

    The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from the possibility of
    obtaining real-time precise 3D depth information using a miniature robust sensor system
    opening up a myriad of opportunities for commercial application. Imaging sensors are
    now widespread and inexpensive, as is computing power, already an integral part of
    most cameras. The 3D imaging sensor to be developed enables disruptive applications
    for manufacturing, robotics, human-machine interfaces, unmanned aerial vehicles, and
    emerging 3D scanners.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is focused on the
    design, development, and testing of a miniature, robust, low-cost optical imaging sensor
    system capable of acquiring three-dimensional (3D) information from a scene with high
    precision and accuracy, overcoming current state-of-the-art technologies. The sensor
    provides, from a single shot, an image and a depth map; associating each object
    feature with its precise 3D location. With the advances in sensing technology, 3D
    information is increasingly incorporated into real-world applications?from

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the assistive use by blind people of thermal imaging. The resulting product provides a person who is blind or visually impaired with the relevant information about the layout of an unfamiliar public space in order to assist blind users in everyday activities. Thermal imaging can differentiate people and objects from their background without the need for complex image analysis. The shape and the temperature of the human body allows the location of people to be easily determined. The societal impact will be assisting users in navigation of complex public spaces. A blind person can use a smartphone?s haptic touchscreen display to examine the thermal image to determine the location of people in front of them. Information about the layout of an unfamiliar public space can be learned from the heat and shape of materials. Examples would be locating vending machines like ATMs and train passes. The market sector for this technology will likely extend beyond assisting blind users, to include additional commercial opportunities as well.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will leverage past National Science Foundation Funded research to develop a product that a blind/low vision user can use to receive practical navigation and interaction information about their environment from a multimodal thermogram (thermal image) interface on a smartphone. There are no practical assistive technologies for blind or low vision users that allow them to locate people, objects, and the layout information of their surroundings other than exploring with a cane. This development will address the objective of creating an interface that provides both practical utility and will be accepted by the target demographic of blind users. This project represents an excellent translational path from NSF-sponsored research programs to a product that is built from the ground up on solid theoretical underpinnings and empirical findings from multimodal human information processing. This development will use thermal radiation from people, machines, lighting and heat retention differences in building materials and convert this data into a user interface to facilitate blind navigation and environment interaction. The product resulting will be a multimodal (kinesthetic, vibro-tactile, and auditory) interface for blind users of a smartphone to interpret and gain useful value from thermal image information.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in promoting the protection of human health, the environment, and our nation's natural resources by providing new sensors that enable fast, accurate, cost-effective sampling and analysis tools to monitor pollution and exposure. The innovations developed here will allow for the rapid identification and detection of hazardous compounds in water at substantially reduced cost. These technological innovations will translate into triple bottom-line savings of companies by enhancing our ability to protect people and the planet, while simultaneously providing cost and time savings to the business. The technology embodies the concepts of sustainability and ease of use, and will achieve broad commercial appeal by saving businesses money, time, and effort while also giving them more data on potential sources of pollution. Scientifically, this technology will enable more precise assessment of environmental pollution by providing more rapid measurement capability at a larger scale than is currently possible.


    This project will develop an innovative, market-disruptive technology for measuring toxic metals in water. This technology is inexpensive, portable, and does not require any power or external reading equipment. Furthermore, it can be adapted to a wide range of toxic compounds after initial commercialization around metals analysis. The system costs an order of magnitude less than the current "point of need" technologies capable of quantitative determination of toxic metals in water, and two orders of magnitude less than the traditional laboratory tests. Access Sensor Technologies is a new startup, but the core team has a strong track record in the field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for environmental analysis where the proposed system represents a major innovation in the field. The proposal has four technical objectives: (1) Expand the palette of applicable chemistry to include additional metals: cadmium, lead, manganese, and both chromium 3+ and 6+; (2) Test the prototype system in a relevant laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment; (3) Achieve a successful customer-driven demonstration of the system in the field; and (4) Identify key elements of manufacturability that define the roadmap to production of the system at market scale.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enhance global food security. Aquaculture
    is the fastest growing agroindustry while the world fisheries catch has leveled
    out. Consequently, half of all seafood consumed today is farmed. Unfortunately,
    at least 30% of fish feed is derived from forage fish, the anchovy and sardine-types
    at the base of the food chain. With demand for forage fish growing while wild
    populations remain level at best, the price of fish meal and oil (FM&0) climbs
    by 15% yearly. Clearly, dependence on FM&O is unsustainable. For fish farmers
    to thrive without abusing the oceanic ecosystem, substitutes are essential. One
    solution is to use vegetable-based ingredients such as wheat and soy, but these
    lack vital omega-3 fatty acids. Another is to turn to the insect world, especially
    by culturing ecofriendly black soldier fly larvae (BSFL). The larvae are fed seafood
    residuals mixed with marine kelp and/or microalgae so that the natural omega-3
    passes through. The larvae are dried and separated into FM&O-like meal and oil.
    The overarching question is: can this be accomplished competitively? Apparently
    it is possible, but a 2-year pilot plant is required to prove the practicality.
    \ \n\nThe proposed project will not only demonstrate that very large volumes of
    BSFL can be cultured using omega-3 loaded wastes and algae, but that substitute
    fish feeds that are palatable, stimulate growth and confer health are feasible.
    This is best achieved by simultaneously conducting feeding trials with a variety
    of species, including isolated bottom dwellers such as black sea bass and, alternatively,
    schooling pelagic creatures such as California yellowtail. Observing degrees of
    palatability is straight forward. But as with any cuisine there are numerous ways
    to enhance the offering: live, dried or pelletized and, if the latter, unit size,
    moisture content and even some surface additive that confers a natural taste ?
    perhaps crab-like for black sea bass and squid-like for California yellowtail.
    Such refinements grant significant economic margins by virtue of better survival
    rates, shorter time in the tanks and less costly ingredients. At this local level,
    both the farmer and the consumer benefit while globally these gains can favorably
    impact food security, especially with marine species that only require saltwater,
    with recirculating system that discharge little or no waste and, of course, with
    substitute foodstuff derived from waste bio-remediated by flies."

    unaffordable, refrigeration costs account for 60% of a retail store?s electricity bills and equipment
    manufacturers are only realizing incremental efficiency improvements with new vapor compression
    architectures. This project introduces an energy storage technology, embedded in a natural refrigerant
    cooling cycle, that provides load-shifting services and a 40% reduction in commercial freezer electrical
    purchases. More importantly, it achieves this at a 3-year payback without government incentives using
    natural, near ambient, materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate an energy storage
    technique utilizing water as the storage material in a time delayed, freeze-point-suppression refrigeration
    cycle. The project will focus on the internal testing, third party validation and commercial demonstration
    of a 10kWth system. Successful integration within low temperature refrigeration architectures requires
    industrial design focused on skid/waste heat integration, validation testing to inform required part count
    reductions/system revisions and demonstration to monitor, learn and revise the technology in preparation

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a new standard of quantifying touch for industries currently relying on qualitative data from expert sensory panels (the tactile equivalent of professional wine tasters). Advancing the understanding of the role and function of tactile sensing in perception and manipulation is also essential if robots are to behave like humans. Studies have demonstrated that humans who cannot feel due to permanent disease or temporary anesthesia perform poorly in fine manipulation tasks (similar to even the best robotic systems without touch). The research proposed in this project is the next step to bring tactile sensing and sensory-motor intelligence to the next generation of robotics. The successful demonstration of a tactile sensor with perceptual similarity to the human fingertip would mark substantial progress in the field of telemanipulation, bringing the world one step closer to remote haptic perception.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop the world's first standard of human tactile perception. It has been proposed that tactile recognition presents a more difficult problem than vision and hearing, requiring not only intelligent sensory processing, but also intelligent algorithms to select and control movements, which have a tremendous influence on what is sensed. Artificial sensors that mimic the mechanical properties and sensitivity of the human fingertip have not existed until recently. The research proposed herein will test hypotheses that a biologically inspired robotic system can measure properties that correspond to subjective percepts, descriptors and associations that humans use to characterize objects by touch.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a safe and effective cure for fungal
    nail infections. In addition, the technology developed in this project could be
    utilized in other healthcare treatments such as skin and wound disinfection, decontamination
    of teeth and gums (oral hygiene), and the sterilization of medical instruments
    and implanted devices.  Fungal nail infection rates are growing at an estimated
    7% annually following both the general aging of the population and the rise in
    the incidence of diabetes. 50% of elderly over the age of 70 and 30% of all diabetics
    are affected. For many people, their infected nails are painful and embarrassing.
    Worst of all, diabetics with fungal nail infections are at increased risk for
    foot ulcerations, gangrene, and amputation. 38 million Americans suffer from nail
    fungal infections and spend over $3 billion dollars each year on treatments that
    are ineffective and sometimes unsafe. People suffering with nail fungal infections
    express widespread dissatisfaction with the limited success, side effects, high
    cost and inconvenience of current treatments.  \n\nThe proposed project will complete
    prototype development of a novel, safe, and effective treatment option for onychomycosis
    (nail fungal infection).  The medical device will allow a doctor to fumigate the
    infected nail with gas because gas can penetrate the nail and kill the fungus
    where all other treatments cannot reach. The human toe nail lacks a blood supply
    to deliver optimal immune system protection to fight off fungal infections. This
    project will develop a device that converts the air above the surface of the toe
    nail into the same gases used by the immune system to fight infection. Hence,
    the gas treatment would safely mimic the normal blood supply of anti-microbial
    chemicals. This SBIR project will reduce technical development risks, improve
    the device usability by doctors, and establish the manufacturability of the device.
    Device prototypes will be validated in the laboratory and with users (Podiatrists).
    The clinical-ready prototypes developed during this project will be used in future
    clinical trials that will prove the efficacy and safety of the device needed to
    sell the product. The device promises to fulfill the unmet medical need for a
    safe and effective treatment option for the millions of Americans suffering with
    fungal infected nails."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development and commercialization of a new technology for non-invasive preclinical imaging.  This platform technology will be used in studies of disease or in in drug development.  The project will further develop and validate an imaging platform based on three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, which is a low cost, high-throughput alternative to existing whole-body imaging modalities, and will provide more sensitivity and field of view than current two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound approaches.   The technology developed will reduce costs of whole-body preclinical imaging, and enable access to this technology to smaller research organizations.  Increased availability of a low-cost imaging tool for preclinical disease and drug development studies could accelerate progress in improving human health while reducing cost burdens on life science labs.

    The proposed project addresses the problem that 2D ultrasound is a preferred imaging modality in preclinical studies due to the adequate resolution, high throughput, and low cost; however, it suffers from user variability and inadequate field of view.  The research objectives will be to continue the development and validation of a 3D ultrasound system which overcomes challenges of user variability and inadequate field of view.  Specific technical goals will be to improve both the hardware and software of the system for increased throughput, integrating the system components into a cohesive customer-facing product, and calibrating and validating the system for its intended preclinical imaging application. Expected results will be a novel technology ? an automated 3D preclinical ultrasound system, which will substantially improve the performance and capabilities of preclinical ultrasound imaging, yet will retain the low-cost and high throughput characteristics of ultrasound imaging.  This new technology will fill a need present in nearly every academic research institution as well as pharmaceutical and contract research organizations worldwide.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the automated manufacture of lightweight high-strength carbon fiber composite materials. Experts agree that composite manufacturers must lead innovations in sustainability, price reduction, and cycle-time reduction to meet end-market needs. The innovations proposed in this project, coupled with Vistex Composites' cutting edge Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process, directly address these needs by significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in composites manufacturing equipment. The prevailing motivation for short automated cycles is posed by the automotive industry, where lightweighting delivers major benefits for fuel consumption but where current processes cannot affordably and quickly produce carbon fiber automotive parts in large numbers. The equipment innovations proposed will not only enhance the automotive market but will have substantial commercial value across all composite markets as they allow the manufacture of equivalent quality products, faster, with less waste, significant energy savings, and at lower cost. Furthermore, the proposed automated process will enable Vistex in its aggressive path towards not only broader adoption of its Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process technology but also broader adoption of composite materials. This will directly drive manufacturing job creation, for Vistex and its customers, as composites displace foreign produced goods.


    This project addresses the design, fabrication, and analysis of an automated composite manufacturing cell using Vistex's patented Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process as the central technology. The standard composite manufacturing process, the autoclave, has long cycle times (hours), requires significant manual labor, and is expensive. Vistex's proposed manufacturing cell addresses these concerns. In the proposal manufacturing cell will be designed and fabricated to make a composite product using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling but where parts (1) can be moved rapidly and accurately using automation, (2) rapidly cured using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling, and (3) rapidly ejected/removed from the tooling, all while creating an equivalent or superior product to with significant cycle time savings over the industry's standard autoclave process. Through the use of material testing, cost analysis, and other metrics, each stage of the proposed manufacturing cell will be benchmarked against industry standard processes. The anticipated result will be a prototype turnkey rapid automated manufacturing cell and commercially usable products for project partners.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop a novel platform technology: a high-torque electrostatic motor (EM). This readily scalable platform machine technology can provide any desired torque or power rating necessary along with increased energy accessibility and reduced energy/operating costs compared to traditional steel-copper-magnet based motors. Instead of using permanent magnets or wire coil mechanisms, this motor exploits electrostatic forces between closely spaced, conductive metal plates to create an electric field, with shaft-torque capabilities far beyond those of conventional machines. By allowing industry more efficient operations, resources will be freed for continued innovation, spurring economic growth. This EM uses domestically-sourced materials like aluminum, steel, and plastic instead of rare earth elements like neodymium, dysprosium, or samarium used in traditional motors, thus reducing both dependence on foreign supply chains of rare earths and market volatility. EMs will be lighter-weight and less expensive to produce than traditional motors. Value is offered to numerous commercial markets, including electric/hybrid-electric cars, industrial automation, renewable energy (wind turbines), and machines operating in extreme environments (aerospace or down-hole drilling) through lower materials costs, increased reliability, higher efficiencies at low speed, and reduced weight.

    The Small Business Innovation Research Project (SBIR) Phase 2 project will expand understanding of electrostatic machinery, including operational principles, design principles, and strengths/weaknesses of this novel platform technology. This represents the first significant breakthrough in motor/machine technology in almost 150 years. Previously, electrostatic technology had few applications due to a limited body of knowledge, despite occasional study throughout the last century. This was primarily due to technological limitations (low capacitance, the necessity of vacuum used as an insulating medium), whose solution required knowledge spanning multiple technical fields (electric field theory, chemistry, mechanical engineering, material science, and power electronic controls). By addressing these technological limitations in P-I, this project already expanded the body of pertinent engineering and physics knowledge. This P-II project offers opportunities for additional study ranging far beyond those currently envisioned. For example, optimizing electrostatic/mechatronic systems such as sophisticated electrostatic drive systems will likely involve the use of highly-engineered materials (metamaterials and composites); next-generation 3D multiphysics simulation platforms to simultaneously solve fluid dynamic, electrostatic, and thermal behaviors; and development of chemical synthesis processes to maximize electrostatic force production. Advanced manufacturing technologies will likely emerge, leading to possibilities including injection molding or 3D printing of a machine.

    This SBIR Phase II project represents a revolutionary advance in adaptive educational technology systems by using data collected from previous exercises to automatically generate hints and feedback for students. This work addresses the SBIR Educational Technologies and Applications subtopic EA5 - Learning and Assessment by making adaptive learning widely available and by providing tools to assess student performance in order to make interventions as early as possible and help students succeed. While it is well known that adaptive Computer Based Training (CBT) is more efficient and more effective, it has traditionally been cost prohibitive to produce in most domains. By leveraging the latest research in Big Data analytics and Educational Data Mining (EDM), this project will produce adaptive capabilities automatically, dramatically reducing the costs of producing more effective training and making such training widely available. The core customers for this technology will be providers of training systems. This includes publishing organizations, developers of software tools for education, and providers of corporate and government training. Institutions that are struggling to educate students, particularly across STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, will be able to use this technology in their existing teaching systems and thus improve student engagement and performance.

    The final outcome of this project will be an integrated set of software tools that collect data from existing computer/web based training software, and automatically generate adaptive capabilities to create a personalized learning environment for students. It does this by using novel EDM and machine learning techniques to build and organize student and problem models that improve over time as more data is collected. It also provides for the tracking of student progress on specific concepts or skills (knowledge tracing), allowing for easy assessment at any point in time. The system also dynamically selects the students' next problems to maximize student learning and minimize time needed to master a set of skills (problem selection). For complex multi-step problems, this system will provide context-specific, just-in-time hints to help students as they learn. The final product will include data adapters that allow developers of existing software to seamlessly connect with this system. Finally, a main differentiator of this system is the transparent process of data curation and the related visualization tools that expose the problem- and student-model generation process. This combination of human input and machine learning will provide researchers, developers, and educators tools to explore student data and allow for new insights into how students learn.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve the care of cancer patients by providing an integrated platform for clinical data and image analytics to their care providers for better clinical decision making. Tight integration of clinical data with radiology images will enable evidence-based approaches to be used by care providers in oncology. The tools being developed in this project will enable accelerated transition of comprehensive data-driven cancer research into clinical practice for decision making related to diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recent trends, such as wide adoption of electronic medical records and radiological images and availability of powerful computing at reasonable prices have made it possible to improve the prognostic and diagnostic power of data, in particular imaging data analysis in healthcare.  The integrated analytics platform being developed will streamline treatment monitoring by imaging and reduce diagnostic errors; hence increasing the quality to cancer care.

    The proposed project aims to develop an integrated, minable, clinical and imaging data analytics platform for oncology. The platform combines recent advances in data mining, context search, image segmentation and deformable registration into an imaging system deployed at the point of care. The diagnostic potential of clinical and image data will be enhanced by the ability to compare lesion characteristics of the current case to a large repository of lesions from other studies with known diagnosis. The proposed search tool will generate patient cohorts with a given set of diagnosis and treatment conditions and present the related images to the diagnostician. Additional technology will locate and track tumors and provide detailed characterization such as size, shape, location and texture with detailed analytics. A large, minable database of segmented tumors and detailed metrics will advance research into identifying ?imaging biomarkers?. The embedded imaging platform will allow clinicians to access these decision support tools across a wide spectrum of devices from powerful personal computers to tablets and other mobile devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a system to dramatically simplify how course content is shared, discovered, curated and managed in educational institutions. The vast majority of content in educational institutions is in multiple silo-ed repositories. Hence, compliance tracking, aligning curricula with competencies and course authoring are manual and expensive processes. This project aims to unlock these silos and make it simple to search, tag and curate courseware at topic-level across multiple platforms. The technology also extracts student feedback and assessment information and maps it against granular learning objectives to provide new insights to track and improve learning outcomes. By unlocking courseware stuck in silo-ed college systems, this project facilitates a cross-institutional marketplace that enables any institution to share and/or monetize curated high quality content, and conversely have access to curated course packs that may be taught by adjunct faculty, a $2B market opportunity. Simplifying faculty access to Open Educational Resources and curated learning content from other colleges will help drive down student course-pack costs significantly.

    The key technical innovation in this project is seamless extraction of learning content from multiple educational repositories coupled with a syllabus-driven semantically intelligent search and recommendation engine woven into the course curation process. Developing an abstracted mechanism to interface with different types of learning management systems and other repositories, and making it portable without requiring a common content format is a significant innovation. Natural Language Processing techniques combined with curated controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are applied to simplify curation of a course, notably automatic topic identification and instructional tagging. The curation data is leveraged in the semantic search engine to improve recommendation of courseware during course authoring. The goal of the adaptive recommendation engine is to improve discovery and usage of both open educational resources and courseware developed in other colleges, without requiring expensive professional services. Another goal of the project is to extract student feedback seamlessly using IMS defined standards regardless of which learning management system is used to deliver the content. The student feedback, assessment data, grades and other information pulled from various college systems are then correlated to provide rich analytics and visibility of student outcomes and alignment of courseware with competencies.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project engages
    K-12 students in inquiry-based learning not only in STEM education but across
    the curriculum.  The coming of the information age has mandated radical changes
    in the skills set required for 21st century. To teach these skills, as articulated
    in the Common Core Standards, teachers are expected to target students? ability
    to conduct short as well as more sustained research projects. The Internet is
    not only the obvious go-to place for teaching these skills but one of the reasons
    for mandating them. It is the easy access to vast amounts of information that
    has made it possible for everyone to conduct research, analyze data and build
    new knowledge. The problem, however, is that the Internet is not a library with
    reliable and catalogued information that can be searched by topic and, in school
    libraries, by reading level. The development of the proposed technology, a personalized
    librarian on-demand, solves this problem. It offers unprecedented opportunity
    for learners of all ages to engage in inquiry, it enables differentiated learning
    and gives learners a life-long tool to help them understand and critically engage
    with digital information. The target market is not limited to the U.S. The developed
    linguistic algorithms apply to non-English, allowing early targeting of the international
    market by building web curators for other languages. \n\n\nThis project blends
    research on linguistics, psychology of reading, natural language processing (NLP)
    \ and machine learning. Innovative NLP technology is used to detect age-appropriate
    sites that are relevant to the curriculum. The developed technology analyzes the
    reading difficulty and thematic content of websites automatically in real time
    search. The purpose of the system is to make adaptive individualized recommendations
    that match the student's reading level and are appropriate for her current familiarity
    with the topic. The patent pending adaptive component is built using machine learning
    and collaborative filtering methods. The resulting research tool, a personalized
    web curator, is based on novel methods for modeling the student's familiarity
    with the topic of web resources. These methods are extended to include novel analysis
    of video content. Unlike other adaptive educational products, the system's adaptive
    recommendations do not rely on obtaining test scores from the user and corresponding
    them to  pre-labeled, leveled data. The complete solution includes an integrated
    gamified experience that helps the students acquire basic and advanced research
    skills and develop the habit of applying them consistently. The project team includes
    educational technology experts from academia and schools and conducts extensive
    studies evaluating learning benefits by the afforded differentiation in instruction,
    including special education programs and English Language Learners."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to accelerate the pace
    of research and development to enable more rapid deployment of technologies
    into commercial / industrial contexts. In many fields, information is expanding at
    such an exponential rate that finding relevant results to technical knowledge
    searches is increasingly difficult. Further, content is expanding so fast that most
    fields are rapidly forming sub-disciplines, leading to the ?silo-ing? of different
    knowledge sub-domains, a clear challenge to both academia and industry. We
    need ever better ways to organize and present information to users. There are
    disadvantages of the current search engines, mostly relating to excessive
    similarity in search results. Further, while these engines present information
    relating to a known search target, they are less effective at presenting
    unexpected results for information that a user has never heard of but that would
    be useful. What is therefore needed is an exploration system giving searchers a
    strong serendipitous element with a maximum likelihood of results from diverse,
    unexpected, and potentially provocative sources. This will break down silos by
    providing a rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different
    disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. This system has been designed
    to provide a means for systematic, automated discovery.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is focused on
    optimizing and scaling a serendipitous document search system for repurposing
    technologies by analogy into lateral fields. Both by sub-parsing discrete content
    into ontologically separable entities, such as capability, characteristic, and
    composition, and by comparatively assessing certain of these attributes between
    such entities, the attribute relatedness of these entities can be used to drive their
    self-assembly into related attribute networks. This approach provides a
    significant value proposition for drug repurposing, which is the current focus of
    this project. To scale the pair-wise comparison and network assembly of millions
    of documents, a map-reduce based text-processing framework will be developed
    so that massively parallel computations can be carried out in a time- and costefficient
    manner. A distributed search engine technology will be deployed to
    enable rapid querying of the emerging document relationship network. A series of
    machine learning algorithms will then be used to determine potentially hidden
    structural architectural features within the document relationship network.
    Machine learning will elucidate the nature of the relationships in drug networks
    through analyses of inter-node relationships and sub-graph motifs (termed
    ?innovation motifs?). Documents including U.S. patents and scientific papers will
    be processed in the system.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that more patients will benefit from minimally
    invasive surgery, in which operations are completed through tiny incisions.  In
    addition to patient benefits of less postsurgical pain, less scarring, and quicker
    recovery, minimally invasive surgery also reduces healthcare cost due to shorter
    hospital stays and lower risk of post-operative complications. Minimally invasive
    surgery impacts all surgical specialties, including gynecology, general, bariatric,
    urologic, and cardiothoracic. Although more than 1.5 million such procedures are
    performed in the US each year, wider adoption is limited by the high cost of current
    surgical robots, training burden of traditional hand-held instruments, and complexity
    of certain minimally invasive procedures. The technology developed via this project
    will enable surgeons to perform complex minimally invasive procedures such as
    hysterectomy with minimal training and at a fraction of the cost of surgical robots.
    Surgeons will benefit from this ergonomic design that will significantly reduce
    the incidence of workplace related injury associated with many laparoscopic instruments.
    This development effort will lead to a versatile platform technology that can
    impact nearly all kinds of surgeries enabling a wider adoption of minimally invasive
    surgery. \n\nThe proposed project aims to complete the design, development, verification,
    validation, regulatory clearance and commercial launch of a laparoscopic articulating
    needle driver. This novel low-cost minimally invasive surgery technology provides
    enhanced dexterity and intuitive control that is seen only in multi-million dollar
    surgical robots. Minimally invasive surgery is performed through small holes on
    a patient?s body to minimize trauma, blood loss, and recovery time, and generally
    involves suturing, knot-tying, and fine dissection, all of which would benefit
    from enhanced dexterity in the surgical instrument. Currently available low-cost
    mechanical (non-robotic) instruments either lack dexterity or are counter-intuitive
    to operate, resulting in surgeon fatigue and significant training requirements.
    Robotic instruments provide exceptional dexterity and intuitive control, but are
    costly and beyond the reach of many hospitals and patients. The proposal minimally
    invasive surgery technology platform overcomes this affordability versus functionality
    tradeoff via a novel forearm mounted tool configuration and innovations in parallel-kinematic
    virtual center mechanisms that makes the tool input joint coincident with the
    surgeon?s wrist. This results in a natural and intuitive motion transmission from
    the surgeon?s hand to the tool end-effector via a low-cost design that does not
    require any sensors, actuators, or computer-control."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. The proposed technology could drastically improve the overall effectiveness of pest management programs in various agricultural industries. The proposed system not only eliminates one of the most laborious and dreaded activities of manually inspecting insect traps, but also provides unprecedented access to accurate, real-time insect population information to make more effective pest management decisions. This leads to reduced, spatially-restricted pesticide applications, better understanding of insect pest behaviors, and enhanced biological control. The automated trap?s ability to monitor more than one species of insect not only achieves a higher level of efficiency in pest monitoring but also multiplies the technology?s value to the end users. The potential market for the proposed technology is quite broad. In fact, the technology can benefit any industry that requires regular monitoring of insect populations. Furthermore, the proposed technology could be used for various state and federal pest monitoring programs, such as the Slow the Spread (STS) Project administered by USDA to monitor gypsy moths.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes to develop a multi-modal sensor platform for robust detection and classification of multiple insect pest species for automated monitoring of insect populations in production agriculture. The main goal of this project is two-fold: First is to demonstrate that bio-impedance sensor alone provides useful data to classify multiple insect species. A linear support vector machine classifier using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients extracted from bio-impedance data will be implemented on an embedded platform for detection and classification of two insect pest species. These bio-impedance based electronic traps will undergo large-scale field trials and be prepared for full commercialization. The second objective is to develop a multi-modal electronic trap with ultrasound, infrared and bio-impedance sensors that can simultaneously monitor four or more insect pest species. Measurement signals generated by the sensors will be analyzed to determine a set distinct features that can be computed on an embedded platform for real-time processing. These features will then be used in multi-modal sensor fusion algorithms for robust detection and classification. Different sensor fusion strategies will be investigated and the performance of each fusion algorithm will be evaluated both in controlled and field conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can strongly influence the healthcare system. The technology of the proposed project has the potential to make a broader impact by decreasing the risk of performing the bone graft harvesting procedure compared to current methods and consequently increase the number of surgeons who choose to collect a patient?s own bone graft in lieu of using inferior bone graft alternatives/substitutes. Furthermore, whereas fewer new, inexperienced surgeons are currently being trained to utilize the patient?s own bone graft because of the risks of current harvesting methods, these surgeons may be encouraged to perform the harvesting procedure with the introduction of the proposed concept. The increase in use of the patient?s own bone will benefit patients because of the widely accepted clinical benefits of autogenous bone graft compared to synthetic or exogenous alternative solutions. The proposed technology may also have a significant commercial impact to hospitals because of potential decreases in operating room time and post-operative patient hospitalization time (compared to the standard harvesting procedure) as well as decreased per-procedure product costs (compared to substitute bone graft products).

    The proposed project addresses the important unmet clinical need of enabling orthopaedic surgeons to collect bone graft from the patient?s pelvic bone in a minimally invasive manner without the patient morbidity and added surgical time intrinsic to the current standard bone graft harvesting methods. The research objectives of the proposed project are to explore various design enhancements to the minimum viable product and assess the impact of these changes on the value proposition; and to explore adjustments to the minimum viable product and assess their fit for use in additional surgical procedures not accessible by the minimum viable product. These objectives will be completed by investigating various new product features and manufacturing processes as well as testing these concepts in various pre-clinical settings. This project has strong intellectual merit because this transformative technological concept has the potential to disrupt the current methods that surgeons employ for harvesting bone graft by introducing a novel solution that improves patient outcomes, surgical time, and hospital costs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a cornerstone for reliable electricity and a modernized grid able to evolve alongside emerging customer demands. Reliable electricity is key component of an industrialized market, critical for the information age, and an enabler for non-industrialized regions evolution and eventual world economic contribution.  The societal benefit therefore of GridBridge's commercially feasible Grid Energy Router is colossal, as it is the step-function change required to truly orchestrate a grid to match this era.  This project will enable numerous hindered technologies and scientific understanding related to energy storage, photovoltaic and other renewable generation, as well as electric vehicles and their correlated fast chargers.  Energy savings are also a monumental aspect and are expected to be in the trillions of dollars.  Society needs electricity to maintain civilization and an updated grid is imperative for supplying that electricity to an evolved consumer base.  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be the crucial component for the modernized grid an enabler for numerous complementary technologies.  GridBridge's GER will eventually replace millions of installed legacy grid technologies throughout the world.  Furthermore, the continued GridBridge-ERC relationship establishes FREEDM ERC's commercialization ecosystem, which includes 200 diverse students.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project combines various research aspects to commercialize the company?s third breakthrough product for electric utilities, the Grid Energy Router (GER).  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be cornerstone for an evolved grid that can integrate renewables and storage, offer dynamic efficiency gains, and intelligently route power.  Although there has been early work with power electronics merely focusing in the area of high-voltage conversion, the approaches thus far limit commercialization and manufacturability.  GridBridge will combine over three years of company market research and utility voice of the customer, a unique product roadmap, and cutting edge research in the areas of feature implementation and voltage conversion.  Keeping in mind the end market, electric utility requirements have been incorporated: highly efficient, cost-competitive, manufacturable within a specific market window, and scalable both to high power and high voltage.  This project facilitates a cost-effective and electrically-efficient product design ready for industrialization and ultimately grid integration, while simultaneously incorporating valuable features that justify utility expenditure and meet a market window of need.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to fabricate and commercialize Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) that are free from any wavelength limitations imposed by the choice of semiconductor substrate. These revolutionary VCSELs will operate in a single mode with high output power, narrow linewidth and a stable linear polarization for use in spectroscopy and communications. Using 2D photonic crystal structures and substrate-independent reflectors, it is possible to build efficient single mode VCSELs at any wavelength covering the near-infrared and approaching mid infrared (800nm to 2,500nm). High efficiency and high output power are achieved by very low electrical resistance and efficient heat sinking. The first prototype will have the ambitious goal of offering a preferred alternative to DFB lasers in long-haul fiber optic communications and near infrared spectroscopy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes many societal, educational, scientific and commercial benefits.  As a social benefit, the commercialization of this technology will enable faster and simpler air and water contamination measurements, and faster and lower-cost telecommunications. As an educational and scientific benefit, the next generation VCSEL development provides a robust and reliable method for fabricating 2D photonic crystals that are usable for optical signal processing and novel laser designs. Also, the resulting high-efficiency compact lasers with high mode quality can be used for pumping high power solid state lasers; and finally, the high speed versions of these advanced lasers can simplify data communication in fast computer systems used in scientific simulations. As a commercial impact, the additional functionalities of the next generation VCSELs will enable them to break out of their current niche datacom market into broader applications in communications and instrumentation. Their substrate independence will eventually make it possible to process them on silicon and other materials suitable for the final application. This will lead to a significant increase in demand for VCSELs due to the new markets that they will serve.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will extend the basic science of linear interference delay effect filters, enabling ultra-wideband tunable RF filters for all types of RF receivers and instrumentation. It will also extend the engineering science of implementing such filters as integrated circuits. And, its distortion filtering aspect will enable enable signal agnostic,adaptive cancellation of wideband, and in-band, interference, for anti-jamming applications as well as to enhance signal quality for the consumer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential is that it will help achieve the national goal of expanding access to RF spectrum by maximizing
    spectral efficiency with its continuous tuning. Second, it reduces filter cost and space requirements while increasing reliability by eliminating increasingly complex filter banks. This will result in smaller, cheaper and more dependable phones for consumers, which will help drive industry growth. Third, the results of this project will deliver Smartphone GPS accuracy rivaling commercial units, as well as enabling protection of GPS-dependent infrastructure against inadvertent or intentional disruption. Fourth, it will enable precise, jamming resistant GPS navigation by aerial drones used by first responders, homeland security and the military, helping prevent crashes that place people at risk.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop software and a system that enables nearly automatic generation and maintenance of a global database of indoor maps through crowdsourcing and data fusion. The current state of the art in indoor mapping relies on a manual labor-intensive process to create and maintain maps as they change over time, which is difficult to scale. A dynamic map-building system will address the challenge of generating and updating key indoor map navigation data. The developed mapping software will use existing embedded Smartphone sensors to discover building features (such as hallways, elevators, exits, and stairwells) and their connectivity as a user walks through a building while carrying a Smartphone running the mapping application.  Additional building signature information is collected as part of the map. The user's location, which is simultaneously being tracked using the same sensors, is used to identify the location of the discovered building features. The map accuracy and completeness will increase as the number of users increase.  This indoor map database will be used for improved indoor location and routing.

    The broader/commercial impact of the mapping software is that it will enable map coverage to increase beyond high use environments such as malls, airports, and museums.  The dynamic map-building system enables maps to be easily extended to include all commercial buildings and to help address the challenge of maintaining and updating indoor map navigation data as they change over time.  The data produced by the system will complement and integrate with indoor map data being made available by leading indoor map suppliers. Indoor maps can be used to power a wide array of applications, and they are clearly essential for making location-based applications work. These applications include consumer applications as well as critical safety applications. Locating people (including children) in emergency situations becomes possible if the software can both calculate their location and show it on a clear map that includes essential floor plan data that makes it easy to reach them. Navigating out of a building in an emergency is possible if the open pathways, stairwells, entrances, and exits are clearly marked on a map.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the rapidly growing threats to endpoint security from attacks and data loss over USB. At present, virtually all USB security measures are located as software on the host or as a secured physical device. Neither of these approaches is truly capable of addressing the vulnerability as a whole - software solutions can be bypassed and a physical peripheral device cannot secure the data that is transmitted on the bus. The proposed technology is located next to the host, so it is capable of securing the entire bus. Our specific technical objectives include the construction of a security device capable of stopping representative attacks in the USB Threat Model that are not solved by existing solutions. Such a device would enable a disruptive improvement in the field of USB cybersecurity. The anticipated results for proposed project will be the development of the product for deployment to customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project would be a disruptive change to USB security. USB security has become critical for many organizations with secure networks, especially healthcare, financial, and defense institutions. The number of data loss incidents over USB has exploded with the availability of smart devices and tablets. USB attacks compromised Predator drones in 2011 using USB drives, and the Military has implemented USB bans, degrading productivity and increasing costs. Despite USB bans, attacks and data loss over USB continue. The proposed device is capable of providing unprecedented levels of security to USB and a framework to build future security infrastructure. To stimulate continued innovations in security and mobile devices markets, we plan to open our platform to the greater scientific and commercial community to develop the next generation of algorithms to stop attacks and data loss over USB. Since our device provides access to USB data with an API, it can enable students and professionals to rapidly ramp up their understanding of USB without the need of expensive hardware and proprietary software. Our device can be integrated inside PCs and smart devices, which would impact the security of every computer, smart device, networks and the ?cloud?.

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will perfect a proprietary batch-scale processing technique for fabricating ultrahard and ultrasharp atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips.  The new process involves two steps.  First, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is used to coat the tips with a chemically inert, highly conductive, and extremely hard material. Second, a patented process that we have developed, field directed sputter sharpening (FDSS), sharpens the probe tip to atomic dimensions (1- 4 nm radius of curvature at the tip apex).  Hard, sharp tips are of considerable scientific and market interest because tip geometry and mechanical properties significantly impact the results of AFM measurements. The current project will carry out research to perfect a batch wafer-scale process able to manufacture hundreds of tips at once.  In order to bring the technique to market, the following research and development tasks will be carried out: (a) optimization of process conditions to reproducibly sharpen arrays of AFM probes fabricated on 4-inch wafers, (b) investigation of the ability to coat and sharpen AFM probes with a variety of hard film materials, and (c) assessment of the performance of batch-fabricated probe tips for market-driven probe microscopy applications.

    The broader/commercial impact of the project arises from the development of robust, reproducible, and durable tips that are more resistant to wear (due to the high hardness) and have favorable characteristics for AFM imaging (small radius of curvature, controlled aspect ratio, and electrically conductive). The project will benefit the academic and industrial communities who use scanning probe microscopy imaging. Although AFM and related probe microscopies have many advantages over electron microscopy (e.g., they can be used under ambient conditions and they can be easily interfaced with optical spectroscopy), one significant drawback is that the probe tips have limited lifetimes owing to wear during use. The development and commercial introduction of probe tips that are ultrasharp, very hard, conductive, and relatively inexpensive will significantly enhance the capabilities of AFM and related techniques such as scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM), a technique of great interest to the microelectronics industry because it is useful for the on-board testing of integrated circuits for delay faults. The research will also be of benefit to those who image insulating surfaces such as polymers and other soft materials where static charge build-up limits efficacy, and to those developing multi-tip probe arrays for lithographic and nanomanufacturing applications.

    This project will enable students to learn difficult science concepts using a collaborative gaming approach that aims to significantly increase student engagement and understanding. This game is being developed to improve the instruction of photosynthesis and cell respiration, which are required curriculum for high school students in life science courses. These processes are largely invisible, comprised of a complex and interdependent set of interactions, and difficult to teach. By creating educationally sound interactive tools to undertake complicated science subjects, the project aims to increase secondary student involvement and interest in STEM, and to help build the core scientific knowledge and higher-order thinking skills they will need to address the challenges of the 21st Century. The app content and design is based on evidence-based pedagogical approaches to effective science instruction. Developing a more immersive and practicable learning method upholds the NSF's mission to promote exceptional science education and will help attract and prepare more students for STEM-based careers. This work will provide teachers with an instructional tool that conveys accurate details of chemically-based biological processes, enable them to deliver differentiated instruction to their classes, and ensure that all their students, whatever their level of pre-existing knowledge and ability, are able to meet the prescribed national and state-level life science standards.

    The project proposes to develop and implement a working simulator that produces scientifically accurate output for a virtual lab learning environment, with which students can quickly build practical understanding of the scientific method through trial and error. This enables a) the introduction of legitimate agency into student learning so that their choices drive the learning, b) the generation of meaningful (non-generic) instructional prompts that respond precisely to how each individual interacts with the game, and c) the establishment of a valuable framework for assessing student learning based on their multiple authentic interactions with the simulator. The simulator will represent biological processes using a mathematical model in order to support an arbitrary range of hypotheses. Additional innovations include a) automated tools that differentiate instruction at the classroom level to help teachers address a range of student proficiencies, from remedial to advanced, b) expanded device-to-device student interactions that utilize collaborative assessments and argumentation games, c) app management tools that enable teachers to organize, monitor and assess individual student participation within these collaborative activities, and d) the integration of relevant geohistorical climate data into each player's "reward garden" in order to build aptitude and foster interest in quantitative analysis activities. Classroom testing will be conducted to validate our approach and demonstrate efficacy.

- abstractText: "This project creates an educational, touchscreen-based software that
    translates visual educational content into accessible, multisensory content for
    students with special needs, and particularly those with blindness and visual
    impairments. Consider the challenge in the educational landscape today: schools
    are increasingly adopting digital tools oriented toward creating a more interactive,
    personalized experience for mainstream students, but at the same time, are struggling
    to accommodate their diverse student population, particularly, the 6 million students
    in special education in the U.S. This problem is exaggerated in Science, Technology,
    Engineering, and Math (STEM), where content is often complex and visual. This
    project addresses these challenges, building on what we already know about human
    information processing and haptic interfaces to create software that will automatically
    convert highly visual content into content that can be seen, heard, and felt in
    real-time in class. This project supports NSF?s mission ensuring that inclusion
    of all students is at the forefront of the digital transformation of U.S. classrooms.
    The societal impacts of this work overcome several barriers impeding students
    with special needs from being independent and active contributors in the STEM
    educational experience and ultimately, many STEM professions. ViTAL projects a
    direct, financial return on investment for taxpayers within three years of operations,
    generating both revenue and new jobs, with plans to multiply this growth year
    over year. \n\n\nThe innovation in this project is the creation of methods and
    algorithms for effective translation of visual content into multimodal content,
    appropriately down sampled for the nonvisual sensory channels yet effective in
    conveying the most meaningful information. Such a conversion currently does not
    exist, which results in high overhead costs to create accessible graphics and
    is a major pain point in special education, particularly for individuals with
    visual impairments or blindness. Further, translating graphical content from the
    visual to the multimodal (visual, auditory, and haptic) space is not a straightforward
    conversion due to the limited bandwidth of human touch compared to vision and
    the complexity of features presented in graphical information. This challenge
    is exaggerated when accounting for the varying types of haptic feedback that can
    be provided from varying platforms (Android and iOS). This project addresses these
    challenges, creating a streamlined solution for generating accessible, multisensory
    content, in real-time, on commercial platforms for K-12 classrooms. The outcomes
    of this project will (1) create the algorithms needed to provide an automated
    conversion from the visual to multimodal space, (2) establish a teacher \"dashboard\"
    to streamline the proposed software?s integration in the classroom, and (3) expand
    the software to the iOS market while simultaneously uncovering novel haptic effects
    that leverage Apple?s unique Taptic feedback. Upon completion of the development,
    the software will be beta tested with partnering schools, and then released on
    both Android and iOS markets."

    This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.

    This project will improve the awareness and perception of careers that require science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance.

    The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions.

    This project will address the need for accessible, creative music education. Over 90% of Americans believe music education is valuable, but very few people ever learn enough to create their own music. Instrument lessons are a great way for some beginners to learn about music; however, instrument lessons are expensive and difficult, and focus on performance and technique at the expense of creativity. This project uses a simple audiovisual composition interface to empower music learners to create their own original music on mobile devices from the very beginning of their music education. By combining this intuitive composition interface with data tracking and analysis, this project creates the opportunity to provide music makers with personalized, adaptive feedback as they compose. Currently, $3 billion are spent each year in the United States on instrument lessons, even though they are unaffordable for many potential customers. By leveraging the proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, this project will deliver an accessible, low-cost digital music education option, creating a new market that includes customers who are currently priced out. Expanding participation in creative music education will increase the quantity and quality of music composed worldwide, while also building a sustainable, revenue-generating business and creating new jobs.

    Through data-driven agile software development, this project will address the need for accessible music education through the creation of a technology platform that delivers adaptive learning to musical beginners. Because the platform upon which this project is built is already empowering the creation of thousands of songs each week and collecting usage data from live users, this project is uniquely positioned to tackle the complex problem of providing algorithmic feedback on creative work at scale. Research and development will proceed in four stages: (1) expanding internal tools to allow for direct analysis of the thousands of songs being created on the platform each week; (2) developing an algorithmic approach to analyzing songs and reporting the results to users; (3) applying analysis to match users with relevant communities and collaborators; and (4) implementing adaptive learning approaches to help users more effectively learn to create music. This staged development process will result in an innovative and highly differentiated technology that enables beginners with no musical experience to compose their own music, and uses data to actively support their individual needs as they learn.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of specialty chemicals. Currently, engineered microbial strains bear mutations that increase the production of chemicals of interest by inhibiting the cell's ability to produce off pathway chemicals. These "loss-of-function" mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell's metabolic flux toward the product of interest. This both boosts the production efficiency and eases downstream purification by eliminating the accumulation of undesirable but chemically-similar contaminants. Unfortunately, these mutations may also decrease the fitness of the cells and, as a result, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to simultaneously direct maximal metabolic flux toward the target chemical of interest while avoiding the need to supplement the growth media. If successful, this technology would provide a great cost savings and enable fermentative production to be applied more broadly in the production of specialty chemicals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a stable and cost-effective fermentative production route to a specialty chemical.  Fermentative production of chemicals offers many advantages over traditional petrochemical or extraction-based production processes.  Petrochemical production maintains the nation?s reliance on an unsustainable feedstock (oil) and also leads to national security issues as the US is largely dependent on foreign oil sources.  Chemical production via extraction from plant materials also has ecological challenges.  The process often uses toxic solvents, and may rely on unsustainable farming practices for many plants that are not traditional food crops.  Engineered microbes fermented on sugar feedstock produced using high-efficiency agricultural practices offer a stable alternative for producing specialty chemicals, both in terms of supply and price.

    The intellectual merit of this proposal is that this program allows highly educated scientists and engineers to acquire real-life research experience and to bring the latest innovative theories and techniques from the academic community o the country?s entrepreneurial technology sector. By working in a cutting-edge laboratory where research and development are accomplished within a framework of expected business outcomes and business constraints, researchers learn to work in multidisciplinary teams and to apply their academic expertise to the important work of product development and application in a globally competitive environment. The small businesses benefit from the fresh insights and most current technological skills and training that the recent postdoctoral students would bring. The program puts those skills and that training to work at creative and inventive research companies which otherwise would not be able to afford such expertise. These pairings would provide active SBIR Phase II companies the opportunity to enhance innovative collaboration, strengthen scientific rigor, and quicken the pace of technological breakthrough. Fellows are also encouraged to publish their work within the overall publishing guidelines set by each participating company.


    The broader impact of this program is to broaden participation of underrepresented groups such as women, African
    Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders in small high-tech companies supported by the NSF SBIR/STTR program. ASEE has proposed stronger outreach strategies than implemented in the current grant to increase visibility and diversity by reaching out to institutions that supply a high number of candidates from underrepresented demographic groups. ASEE is strengthening its outreach by attending postdoctoral and professional organizational conferences that typically target women and underrepresented groups in STEM fields and by having a proactive presence in social media.
