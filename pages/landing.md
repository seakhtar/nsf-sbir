<div class="usa-width-one-half" markdown="1">
Since 1977, the NSF seed fund (powered by SBIR/STTR) has helped startups develop their ideas and bring them to market. We support tech innovation — not just in traditional scientific fields — but [across all tech sectors](#), including edtech, IoT, big data, smart health, hardware, even social networks. Between 2007 and 2016 alone, we funded roughly 400 companies each year.

### We're diverse

Great ideas aren’t limited by geography, and we seek to fund companies both inside and outside of the major tech hotbeds. We also have a mission to promote the innovations of women, people of color, and other folks from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in tech.

We’re always looking to support innovative, high-risk work that needs a bit more research and development. As we review applications, we also consider your company’s potential for commercial and social impact — your technology needs to have a good market fit and the potential to meaningfully benefit society.
