<h2 class="text-large">We are America's Seed Fund</h2>

Since 1977, America’s Seed Fund (formerly known as NSF SBIR/STTR) has helped startups develop their ideas and bring them to market. From 2007 and 2016 alone, we funded roughly 400 companies each year.

<h2 class="text-large">We value diversity</h2>

Great ideas aren’t limited by geography, and we seek to fund companies both inside and outside the major tech hotbeds. We encourage the work of socially and economically disadvantaged people, first-time entrepreneurs, and folks who are traditionally underrepresented in tech.
