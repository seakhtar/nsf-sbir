</div>
<div class="usa-width-two-thirds usa-content" markdown="1">
We’re looking to support groundbreaking, technically risky work that needs more research and development. As we review applications, we consider your company’s innovativeness, commercial plan, and possible social impact.

<h3 class="small-header">We embrace diversity</h3>

Great ideas aren’t limited by geography, and we seek to fund companies both inside and outside the major tech hotbeds. We encourage the work of socially and economically disadvantaged people, first-time entrepreneurs, and folks who are traditionally underrepresented in tech.
