### A cheaper, easier way to test for malaria

For many in sub-saharan Africa, finding out if a fever is due to Malaria often means trekking long miles to a clinic for a relatively pricey blood test, and anxious hours of waiting before the results come in. But the Urine Malaria Test kit developed by Fyodor Biotechnologies has begun to change all that. 

The National Science Foundation helped Fyodor Biotechnologies take this innovation from the lab bench to the market, through NSF's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants.

### Manufacturing equipment to build taller wind turbines on-site

Keystone Tower Systems, a small business funded by the National Science Foundation, has developed tower hub manufacturing equipment to make wind turbines on-site, allowing for the creation of taller towers that can generate more wind power in more places. 

Today’s wind turbine towers are typically assembled from individual pieces that are rolled and welded separately and are size-limited to a 14-foot diameter to be able to be transported from the manufacturing facility to the project site. Current towers are typically about 30 stories tall. 

Keystone Tower Systems has developed a continuous, fully automated manufacturing process for wind turbine towers to create tapered tubes, varying in thickness and diameter. The company can use the equipment on-site, allowing for towers with a larger diameter, which in turn allows the tower to be much taller – 50 stories or taller. 

“Today, we can only cost effectively install wind turbines in a few states that have a good strong wind resource close to the ground,” explains Eric Smith, CEO at Keystone Tower Systems. “As soon as you can make taller towers by making them larger, suddenly you can get a good wind from almost any site so we can bring low-cost wind energy into all 50 states.”

Keystone Tower Systems is supported by the National Science Foundation’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, a nearly $190 million program that awards research and development grants to small businesses and startups, transforming scientific discovery into products and services with commercial and societal impact.

Shasqi, a small business funded by the National Science Foundation, is developing a new way to deliver drugs to specific locations within the body to more effectively treat diseases such as cancer. The team, led by physician and chemist Dr. Jose M. Mejia Oneto, has created a targeting system that could enable effective therapy with lower doses of drugs and fewer harmful side effects.  
  
The system works by first injecting a gel at the treatment site. The gel contains chemicals that combine with and activate an injected, attenuated form of a drug, such as a chemotherapeutic, to trigger its cancer-fighting effect only at the tumor or other targeted tissue. The experimental treatment has been successfully tested against tumors in mice, which experienced tumor shrinkage while maintaining healthier weights than mice receiving traditional chemotherapeutic treatments.

### 3D Printing Like Nature - Branch Technology

Branch Technology, a small business funded by the National Science Foundation, combines 3D printing, industrial robotics, and conventional building materials to enable a new way to build.

“If you look at the creativity and the beauty and the flexibility and the strength that you see in the natural world and begin to think how you can interpret that into buildings, that’s what we’re just on the very beginning steps of exploring,” explains Platt Boyd, founder and CEO of Branch Technology. 

The company is prefabricating architectural wall panels using 3D printing to create a cellular-like structure that they fill in with conventional construction materials, strengthening the structure and function for normal wall assemblies.

Branch Technology is supported by America’s Seed Fund powered by the National Science Foundation, a nearly $200 million program that awards research and development grants to small businesses and startups, transforming scientific discovery into products and services with commercial and societal impact.

### All-in-one weather and crop monitor delivers agricultural insight to farmers

NSF-funded small business Arable Labs has developed a crop and weather sensor that delivers real-time, precision weather information straight to the hands of farmers in the field.
 
The technology packs sensors into portal devices that collect information in the fields on crop health, and then transmits the data to the cloud. Users get a comprehensive overview of weather and plant conditions, according to Arable. At CES 2018, Arable Labs sales manager Andrea McNees explained how the system provides more accurate data than other agricultural technologies and can save farmers time and money. Arable is funded through America’s Seed Fund NSF SBIR/STTR: https://seedfund.nsf.gov/.

### Improving LED brightness and reducing power consumption

<div class="quote-content" markdown="1">

![Rob Nordsell]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/showcase/rob-nordsell.jpg)

> &ldquo;The National Science Foundation was instrumental in getting our company off the ground. We had identified a high-value problem in LEDs that demanded a solution and we identified a unique approach to solving that problem. However, acquiring investor capital for seed stage R&D is very difficult and the investors that do participate in such early financings look to external sources and experts to validate the technology and approach. Our NSF award was, in fact, that source of validation and within two weeks of having received our SBIR Phase I award we closed our Seed round. The NSF is a critical resource for deep-tech startups and we are thankful to have received NSF support throughout Phase I and Phase II.&rdquo;  
>  
> &ldquo;The company started with two founders doing chemistry in a garage, and today the company employs a total of 10 full-time Ph.D. scientists, including the founders, and four part-time Ph.D. scientists. The company is launching its first product by the end of 2017, and this progress would not have been possible without the support of the NSF.&rdquo;

### AI helps medical professionals interpret, perform ultrasounds

Bay Labs, a small business funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), uses artificial intelligence to help medical professionals perform and interpret ultrasounds. 

Bay Labs is using deep learning technology to enable a wider range of medical professionals use ultrasound imaging to quickly and reliably detect serious medical conditions. 

Right now, Bay Labs' technology is being used in cardiovascular imaging to diagnose potentially life-threatening heart conditions – something that now requires a highly trained expert. Ultimately, they’d like to see ultrasound technology used routinely for screening in clinics and for triage in emergency rooms. 

“Cardiovascular disease currently kills more than 700,000 people every year in the United States alone,” says Charles Cadieu, co-founder and CEO of Bay Labs. “We think that this technology can help improve early diagnosis and lead to more preventative treatment of this disease.”

Bay Labs is supported by America’s Seed Fund powered by the NSF, a nearly $200 million per year program that awards research and development grants to small businesses and startups, transforming scientific discovery into products and services with commercial and societal impact.

### Detecting biological contaminants in water & pharmaceuticals

Spheryx, Inc., a small business funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), created a technology to monitor, count and characterize microscopic particles in a variety of fluids, such as water, chemicals, or even pharmaceuticals.

The Food and Drug Administration has identified groupings of proteins, called protein aggregates, as a significant safety hazard for biologic pharmaceuticals, which are widely considered the most promising class of new drugs. Protein aggregates are very hard to detect, and ingesting them can lead to severe immune reactions, sometimes even leading to death.  

Spheryx’s technology can detect, monitor and characterize protein aggregates suspended within pharmaceutical products, leading to safer products for the consumer and reduced manufacturing cost for the manufacturers. The technology is based on holographic video microscopy, which uses a microscope with laser light to create holograms of particles within cells. The holograms encode the three-dimensional information about the particles, and Spheryx extracts information to determine whether there are protein aggregates in the sample.  

Spheryx is supported by America’s Seed Fund powered by NSF, a $200 million program that awards research and development grants to small businesses and startups, transforming scientific discovery into products and services with commercial and societal impact.
