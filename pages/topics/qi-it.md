The Quantum topic focuses on innovations in information and communications technologies that rely fundamentally on quantum mechanical properties and interactions. Typically, such innovations will involve the generation, detection or manipulation of quantum states in order to provide faster, more efficient or more secure information processing and communications. Quantum proposals could include innovations at the component, sub-system and system level that result in substantial and usable improvements in the generation, transmission, detection, storage or processing of information, or the security and privacy of information. Proposed innovations must offer the potential for robustness, reliability, scalability, and operation at temperatures that are practical within the constraints of the intended application. Innovations at the component and sub-system level should aim for compactness and energy efficiency, consistent with the requirements of the intended application. Applications will in general fall into one of the four broad areas of quantum sensing, quantum communications, quantum simulation and quantum computing.
