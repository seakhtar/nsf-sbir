The Other Topics area is intended to be a home to any proposed project which does not seem to fit into one of the other technology topic areas, but still seems to meet the NSF SBIR/STTR goals of supporting research and development of innovative, risky, unproven technology, with commercial viability and the potential to benefit society.

If you are not sure if your project fits into one of the other technology topic areas, please feel free to send an email to Dr. Schrag, and he can then recommend the best point of contact or path forward.


For Other Topics projects on Distributed Ledger and Blockchain, possible submission topics include, but are not limited to:  distributed ledger technologies, including blockchains, sidechains, tangles and other implementations; security, anonymity and identification; scalability and efficiency solutions; consensus methods; business models innovation; smart contract innovations; organizational structure and collaboration; ease of use and simplification.
 
If you have questions about a project involving Distributed Ledger and Blockchain, please email Dr. Brady-Estevez.
