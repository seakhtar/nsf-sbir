Submitting a SBIR/STTR Phase I Proposal in FastLane

The Phase I SBIR solicitation and STTR solicitation explain what information should go into the proposal. The following steps will walk through the process of submitting a proposal into FastLane, NSF's electronic submission system. Remember to submit your proposal early. FastLane will not accept proposals after 5:00 p.m. (Your time zone is set during online registration in Research.gov).

## 1. FastLane Overview

### Do you have the required registrations?

* [Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS)](https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://iupdate.dnb.com/iUpdate/viewiUpdateHome.htm)
* [System for Award Management (SAM)](https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM)
* [Small Business Administration (SBA) Company Registry](https://www.sbir.gov/registration)
* [NSF Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_home_page) - register your company and Principal Investigator (PI)

Before you can register your small business with NSF and prepare/submit a proposal - you MUST register your company to do business with the U.S. government through the System for Award Management (SAM).  When you register in SAM, you’ll have to share your company's "DUNS number" and bank account information. You'll also have to have an original, signed notarized letter stating that you are the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. The SAM.gov registration process is free and takes only 10-15 minutes to initiate, but can take more than three weeks to complete. SAM registration expires after one year and must be updated annually.  

Once your company is registered in SAM, you are able to register the organization with NSF in Research.gov.  Only after registering with Research.gov can you login to FastLane and begin preparing your proposal. (SBIR and STTR proposals are not accepted in Research.gov).

Companies submitting SBIR or STTR proposals to the Federal government must also register with the Small Business Administration's Company Registry. 

### Register a New Organization

Follow the step-by-step process below to register a new organization in Research.gov.

**How do I register a new organization with NSF?**
* Open [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_home_page)
* Click “Sign In” located at the top right of the screen.
* Enter your NSF ID and password and click “Sign In.”
* Click “My Profile” located at the top right of the screen.
* Click “Add New Role” from the left navigation bar.
* Click “Add Organizational Role” located in the “Add and Manage Organizations” box. 
    * Note: If an organization is new to NSF, you must start the process by setting yourself up as the Administrator for the new organization. You must have an NSF account to start this process. The system will automatically detect that the organization is new and will walk you through setting up the organization and Administrator role.

and you will be able to register the organization and become the first Administrator.

**Helpful Tip:** If a new organization is registered with NSF without an Administrator, the first user to request a role will become the organization’s first Administrator.

* Enter your contact information for the Administrator role, add your organization’s information, and then click “Next.”
(Figure 3)
* Notice the “Administrator” role is pre-selected. Click “Next.” (Figure 4)
* Review your organization’s information for accuracy and click “Submit.” (Figure 5)
* The request to register your organization with NSF will be forwarded via email to your organization’s SAM points of contact for their information only. The SAM points of contact will not need to approve the request. (Figure 6)
