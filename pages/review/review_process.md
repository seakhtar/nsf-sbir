# Review Process

Proposals received by the NSF SBIR/STTR Program are assigned to appropriate topics where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements and are in compliance with the program announcement, solicitation or Dear Colleague Letter (supplements).

All proposals are carefully reviewed by a minimum of three experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Directors charged with the oversight of the review process.

All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: **intellectual merit** and the **broader impacts** of the proposed effort. In the case of the NSF SBIR/STTR Program, critical additional review criteria are utilized to highlight the specific objectives of the program and to ensure that all proposals are reviewed for both their technical and commercial merits.
