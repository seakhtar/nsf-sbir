# Review process

Proposals received by the NSF SBIR/STTR Program are assigned to appropriate topics where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements and are in compliance with the program announcement, solicitation or Dear Colleague Letter (supplements).

All proposals are carefully reviewed by a minimum of three experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Directors charged with the oversight of the review process.

All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In the case of the NSF SBIR/STTR Program, critical additional review criteria are utilized to highlight the specific objectives of the program and to ensure that all proposals are reviewed for both their technical and commercial merits.

- **[FastLane Instructions for Panelists]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/review/panelist-system/)**: How to submit the registration required for every review panel, review assigned proposals, submit reviews, and navigate through the interactive panel system (IPS), which is used during the live panel meeting.

- **[FastLane Instructions for Mail Reviewers]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/review/peer-mail-review/)**: Step-by-step instructions for using FastLane to review a proposal and submit a "mail review" electronically to NSF.

- **[Panelist Conflict of Interest (COI)]**
NSF Panelists must be read and sign the NSF [Conflict-of-Interests and Confidentiality Statement]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/awardees/coiform.docx) the morning of the review. Mail Reviewers Only: Prior to receiving access to any proposal in FastLane, mail reviewers must sign the NSF COI and Confidentiality Statement. Please print and sign the COI Form and scan/email it to the NSF staff person that invited you to review. If necessary, you can fax the COI form to 703-292-9057. In the field "Panel Name" please clearly indicate the proposal number that you were invited to review.
