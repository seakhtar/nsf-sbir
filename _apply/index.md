- Your company must be a legal entity at the time you apply for funding.
- At least 50% of your company’s equity must be owned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and all funded work needs to take place in the United States (including work done by consultants and contractors).
- The project’s tech lead (Principal Investigator) must be legally employed at least 20 hours a week by the company seeking funding. The tech lead doesn’t need any advanced degrees.
- The tech lead needs to commit to at least one month (173 hours) of work on a funded project.
- Finally, you can designate a university faculty member as your tech lead only if they can commit to the 50% employment requirement.

Before starting your application, you’ll want to figure out whether your company is a good fit for the NSF seed fund.

The best way to do this is to send an executive summary to one of our program directors; they’ll schedule a chat with you to discuss your work and offer feedback. You can also check out [our portfolio](link to portfolio page) of companies we’ve recently funded.

- **Seed stage:** Early-stage company in the research or prototyping phase
- **Pre-traction:** Has validated the market and undertaken customer development efforts but has not yet reached product-market fit
- **High-risk:** Product is based on unproven technology for which the funding will be used to validate
- **Scale:** If validated, the product could have massive societal impact and/or venture scale

    </button>
        <div id="a3" class="usa-accordion-content"  markdown="1">
- Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS number) (link) (up to five business days)
A DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your company. You’ll need one in order to receive government funding. Because you’re applying for a DUNS number for government funding, processing time should take about five business days.

- [FastLane](#) (NSF seed fund’s electronic submission system) (link) (Up to 48 hours)<br>
Before applying, you need to register your principal investigator and company in FastLane. Within 48 hours, you’ll get a confirmation email with login instructions. We recommend you explore FastLane before submitting your application.

- System for Award Management (SAM) (link) (Up to three weeks)
Any company that does business with the government needs a SAM account. When you register, you’ll have to share EFT information.

- SBIR Company Registry (link)
Finally, you need to register with the SBIR Company Registry (operated by the Small Business Administration). Post-registration, you’ll receive a Business Concern Control ID (SBC ID), which you’ll need to include in your FastLane application.
