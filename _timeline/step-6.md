### [Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS number)](https://iupdate.dnb.com/iUpdate/viewiUpdateHome.htm)
**Processing time:** Up to five business days
 
A DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your company. You’ll need one in order to receive government funding. Because you’re applying for a DUNS number for government funding, processing time should take about five business days.

### [System for Award Management (SAM)](https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11#1)
**Processing time:** Up to three weeks

You MUST register to do business with the U.S. government through System for Award Management (SAM). When you register, you’ll have to share bank account information. This registration process is free and takes only 10-15 minutes to initiate, but can take up to three weeks to complete. An active SAM.gov registration is needed to create a FastLane account and submit a proposal to NSF. Registration expires after one year. Read the [SAM Quick Start Guide](https://www.sam.gov/sam/transcript/Quick_Guide_for_Grants_Registrations.pdf). 
  
### [FastLane (NSF’s electronic submission system)](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/n1/N1AddInst.html)
**Processing time:** Up to 48 hours
 
Before applying, you need to register your principal investigator and company in FastLane. Within 48 hours, you’ll get a confirmation email with login instructions. We recommend you explore FastLane before submitting your application.
 
 
### [SBIR Company Registry](http://sbir.gov/registration)
Finally, you need to register with the SBIR Company Registry (operated by the Small Business Administration). Post-registration, you’ll receive a Business Concern Control ID (SBC ID), which you’ll need to include in your FastLane application.
