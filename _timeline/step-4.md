**Processing time:** Up to three weeks

You MUST register to do business with the U.S. government through [System for Award Management (SAM)](https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11#1#1). When you register, you’ll have to share bank account information. This registration process is free and takes only 10-15 minutes to initiate, but can take up to three weeks to complete. An active SAM.gov registration is needed to create a FastLane account and submit a proposal to NSF. Registration expires after one year.
