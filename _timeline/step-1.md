### Criteria

Here are the criteria we use to determine which companies to fund:

- **Seed stage:** Your small business is working on a new product or service enabled by innovative, early-stage technology.
- **Pre-traction:** You have evidence that your product or service could meet an important, unmet need for your customers.
- **High-risk:** Your product is based on unproven technology that needs further testing (and funding for that testing).
- **Scale:** If you successfully bring your product to market, it could form the foundation for a scalable business and make a large impact in your target market.
