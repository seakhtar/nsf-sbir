- The project’s tech lead (Principal Investigator) must be legally employed at least 20 hours a week by the company seeking funding. The tech lead doesn’t need any advanced degrees.
- The tech lead needs to commit to at least one month (173 hours) of work on a funded project per six months of project duration.

To see if your company is a good fit, review our evaluation criteria and consider submitting an executive summary to get feedback from our program directors.

**Criteria**

Here are the criteria we use to determine which companies to fund:

- **Seed stage:** Your small business is working on a new product or service enabled by innovative, early-stage technology.
- **Pre-traction:** You have evidence that your product or service could meet an important, unmet need for your customers.
- **High-risk:** The product is based on unproven technology that needs further testing (and funding for that testing).
- **Scale:** If you successfully bring your product to market, it could form the foundation for a scalable business and make a large impact in your target market.
